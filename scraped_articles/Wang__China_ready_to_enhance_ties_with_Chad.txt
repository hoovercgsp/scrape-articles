China is ready to strengthen exchanges of governance experience and comprehensively expand mutually beneficial cooperation with Chad to help facilitate the development and vitalization of the African nation, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.
Wang made the remarks when meeting with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, on Wednesday.
Wang emphasized China's consistent position that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal, saying that Beijing opposes hegemony, bullying and unilateralism.
China appreciates Chad's efforts in upholding independence and self-reliance, and pursuing development and revitalization that suits its national conditions, Wang said, adding that China would like to work with Chad to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.
The Chadian president expressed gratitude for China's long-term support for the development of Africa, especially Chad.
Calling China an important strategic partner and trustworthy friend of Chad, he said that bilateral relations have become a model of mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's cooperation with Africa has always been based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, yielding fruitful results, he said.
Chad is Wang's third stop of his New Year visit, where he also met with Chadian Prime Minister Allamaye Halina and held talks with Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah on Wednesday.

The Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership met on Thursday to hear a series of work reports from the leading Party members' groups of state institutions, including the top legislature, central government, top political advisory body, top court and top procuratorate.
The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also heard a work report from the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over and addressed the meeting.
The meeting noted that upholding the Party's overall leadership is the country's greatest political advantage and that the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee is the fundamental reason for achieving continuous victories.
Last year, the leading Party members' groups of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate resolutely upheld the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership and made significant advancements in various fields, the meeting noted.
The meeting also commended the work of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee over the past year.
Noting that 2025 marks a crucial year in China's drive for further deepening reform comprehensively, the meeting urged the leading Party members' groups to ensure the effective implementation of the CPC Central Committee's decisions and plans.
The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee should complete all tasks to a high standard, with priority given to key initiatives such as implementing intra-Party regulations and addressing unnecessary formalities to reduce burdens on the primary level, according to the meeting.

(ECNS) -- Five years after making headlines for donating 100 million yuan (around $13.65 million) to Fudan University while taking the subway, alumni couple Chen Xiaoming and He Peixin returned to their alma mater last Friday, where they reflected on the experience. "Taking the subway or bus is just normal for us. Living simply and being ordinary is our way of life," they said.
Chen and He, originally from rural areas in Guizhou and Jilin provinces, credited Fudan University for giving them the opportunities that transformed their lives. "We came from humble beginnings and were able to pursue higher education, study abroad, and build careers thanks to the support of our alma mater. We want more underprivileged students to have the same opportunities," they explained.
In December 2019, the couple established the Fudan University Chen Xiaoming and He Peixin Alumni Fund, dedicating 100 million yuan to support students from economically disadvantaged families. Since then, their lives have remained humble. They travel across China with their young grandchildren using public transportation and walking tens of thousands of steps daily.
590 letters, 400,000 words of gratitude
During their visit, Chen and He met with students who benefited from the fund, including Huangfu Botao, who received financial aid as a freshman four years ago. The student who graduated from Fudan’s School of Economics recently won a gold medal at the China International Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for developing an AI-based crystal material generation tool. The innovation focuses on advancing perovskite material research to accelerate the localization of critical advanced materials.
Another beneficiary, He Ruiaoxue, a freshman in the School of Foreign Languages and Literature, expressed her gratitude for the financial support that allowed her to pursue a dual degree in English and Computer Science.
To honor the couple’s generosity, students compiled a four-inch-thick collection of 590 letters of gratitude totaling over 400,000 words. In these letters, "gratitude" was the most common theme, followed closely by "effort."
One student wrote:
"I’ve seen the empty library at dawn and walked the silent streets of Guoquan Road at midnight. Despite the challenges and setbacks, I believe effort can change lives—just as your hard work led to your success."
Another shared:
"Teaching in rural schools and engaging with children who share dreams similar to mine has deepened my resolve to pass on love and warmth to others."
A Legacy of Empowerment
Chen and He, who both graduated from Fudan’s Department of Chemistry in 1977, later pursued graduate studies under renowned Fudan professor Deng Jiaqi. In 1994, they founded a company in Memphis, USA, specializing in electrochemical measurement instruments.
Over the past five years, their fund has supported over 4,000 undergraduate and 5,000 graduate students through scholarships, healthcare subsidies, emergency aid, academic development programs, and international exchange opportunities.
Chen and He’s enduring commitment to education continues to inspire generations of Fudan students, empowering them to overcome challenges and create a brighter future.

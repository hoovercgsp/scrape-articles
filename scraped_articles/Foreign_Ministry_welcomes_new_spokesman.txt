Guo Jiakun, the 35th spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, made his debut at Monday's daily news conference.
Guo, who is 44 and a member of the Mongolian ethnic group, has been working in the Foreign Ministry for nearly 23 years.
"I will try my best to accurately and in a timely manner explain China's foreign policy," Guo said, adding that he expects to work with journalists to present a true, multidimensional and panoramic view of China to the world.
The Foreign Ministry introduced the spokesperson system in 1983, making it the first government department in China to start such a practice. It is also the only government department that holds routine news briefings every working day.

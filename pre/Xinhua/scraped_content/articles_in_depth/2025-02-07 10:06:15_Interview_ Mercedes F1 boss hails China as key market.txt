HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Mercedes Formula 1 team principal Toto Wolff has hailed China as a hugely important market for F1.
Speaking exclusively to Xinhua, Wolff shared his excitement about the team's deepening ties with China, hailing his connection with the country and the Shanghai International Circuit.
"The track is state-of-the-art, and the facilities are top-notch. Shanghai is a fantastic city, and every visit is met with a positive feeling," he said.
The Austrian also noted the dramatic change in China's relationship with F1 in recent years. "Once a sport with limited interest in the country, recent years have seen its popularity soar," he said.
He attributed it largely to a youthful demographic, suggesting that the growth bodes well for the future of motorsport in the country.
According to official F1 statistics, the number of F1 fans in China is estimated to surpass 150 million, with over half of them having started to follow the sport in the past four years. F1's online fanbase in the country has grown to 4.4 million, with an increase of over one million in 2024.
The 2025 F1 season will feature 24 Grands Prix and opens with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 16. The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will be the season's second stop on March 23, and will also host the season's first F1 Sprint event, along with the opening round of the female-only F1 Academy series.
"Having a sprint race means there are [races] on both Saturday and Sunday, which is exciting for local spectators and young audiences. I am really looking forward to meeting the fans in China," Wolff said. â–

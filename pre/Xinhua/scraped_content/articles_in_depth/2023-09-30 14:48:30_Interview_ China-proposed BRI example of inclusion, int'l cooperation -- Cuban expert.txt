HAVANA, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a role model for inclusion and international cooperation, said Eduardo Regalado, a researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba.
"This is a very inclusive project, open to all nations interested in advancing international collaboration and economic development," the expert told Xinhua, adding that the BRI is also in keeping with the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
"The BRI is highly necessary for Global South nations, which need cooperation models that result in economic development," he said, adding that he was impressed by the results achieved by the Chinese people and government over the past few decades.
"All countries that have joined the BRI will meet their needs regarding economic development. This is real cooperation focused on prosperity," he said.
The researcher said that unlike certain major countries, China's relationship with other developing countries is based on mutual respect and support.
"China does not hold authoritarian relations with other countries," he said, adding that the BRI offers practical solutions to global challenges.
Regalado said that the funding behind the BRI is for developing infrastructure and connectivity, which facilitates technology transfers and builds capacity.
The expert suggests countries in Latin America and Africa could use the BRI to further integrate into the global economy.
"The BRI is already contributing to the improvement of living standards of people in Latin America, the Caribbeans and African people," he said, adding that this project also aligns with environmental protection principles. â–

SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali says there are no plans to stage more than one Grand Prix in China.
The Chinese Grand Prix returned this weekend after a five-year absence, and with the Shanghai International Circuit's F1 contract set to end in 2025, Domenicali hinted at an extension, telling Xinhua that "there is the intention to look ahead and work together."
"The relationship with Shanghai has been very important. We will have [a discussion] during this weekend to try to understand the condition to stay here in Shanghai," he added. "We would love to have the race in China."
In a recent announcement, the Guangdong Provincial Development and Reform Commission revealed the "F1 Guangzhou International Circuit Project" as one of its key construction projects in 2024, fueling speculation that China could be set to host more than one Grand Prix.
However, Domenicali poured cold water on that suggestion. "I have to be honest with you. We already have 24 races, which is a big number because there is the demand. [Having] two Chinese Grands Prix in the same championship, I don't think it is possible," said Domenicali.
The Italian added, "We have received so many requests from all around the world. We are not forced to stay in places where we don't believe there is the right ingredients to stay. So yes, a lot of things are happening, but we will make the right decision in the next couple of months." â–

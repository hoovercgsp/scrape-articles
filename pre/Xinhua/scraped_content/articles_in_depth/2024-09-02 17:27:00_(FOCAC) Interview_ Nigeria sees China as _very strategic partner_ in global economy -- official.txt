ABUJA, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria deems China a "very strategic partner" in the global economy, and their strategic partnership will continue, said a government spokesman ahead of 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to be held in Beijing from Sept. 4 to 6.
In an interview with Xinhua in the capital of Abuja, Ajuri Ngelale, the main spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said bilateral relations feature mutual respect and a deep understanding of the importance of win-win cooperation.
The brotherly China-Nigeria relationship, as well as the expanded China-Africa cooperation, has been well demonstrated by the Belt and Road Initiative, FOCAC, and various cultural exchange programs, he said.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and major economy, plays an important role in regional and international affairs.
The West African nation has become China's largest project contracting market in the region, as well as second-largest export market, third-largest trading partner, and a major Chinese investment destination in Africa.
In their fruitful cooperation, the two countries currently have many projects on stream in different sectors such as agriculture, rail, and power, while some others are in the pipeline due to the growing mutually beneficial ties.
Ngelale underscored the pivotal role Nigeria plays in continental cooperation with China, particularly in the context of the FOCAC.
"Nigeria will always be central to any conversation about cooperation between Africa and other regions," he said.
Nigeria's participation in the FOCAC "will be crucial" and also focus on upgrading Nigeria-China relations, as the president will lead a delegation of top government officials to the summit, Ngelale added. â–

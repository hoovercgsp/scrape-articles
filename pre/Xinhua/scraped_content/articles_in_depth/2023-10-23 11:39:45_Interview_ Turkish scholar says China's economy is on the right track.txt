ISTANBUL, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is growing steadily and remains on the right track, a Turkish scholar has said.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 4.9 percent year on year in the third quarter and grew 5.2 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2023.
The pandemic affected many leading economies negatively, but unlike many other economies, China has avoided the scourge of high inflation, said Selcuk Colakoglu, director of the Ankara-based Turkish Center for Asia-Pacific Studies, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
He said that the Chinese government has managed to control inflation "from the beginning," praising China's efforts to push for economic growth.
"The recent numbers show that the Chinese economy is stable ... And the Chinese economic growth rate is higher than the global average, another positive outcome for the Chinese economy," he added.
The recently announced data indicated that China's economy continued to recover, with production and supply increasing steadily. He said market demand has expanded, and the country's development quality has improved.
"So the Chinese economic outlook is much more positive than some other leading economies worldwide," he said.
He said that green and high-quality development will be critical to China's economy, as concerns are rising regarding climate change and environmental issues.
"So transformation from traditional sectors to green development and the green economy will be the key for all countries. China also has a strategic plan in that regard," he added. â–

On July 23, 2024, after nearly three months of negotiations initiated by China in Beijing, the 14 Palestinian factions successfully reached a reconciliation agreement. This significant development aimed to reunite Palestine in response to the escalating Israeli military operation.
Indeed, the successful mediation by China in this matter holds significant implications, especially considering the challenging period for the Palestinian cause since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
These implications extend to various aspects, including China's regional policy and its stance on the Palestinian cause. They also encompass the existential threat facing Palestinians, the broader Arab region, and the transformations occurring on the international stage.
These implications can be highlighted as follows:
Firstly, it is worth noting that China's engagement in Arab regional affairs is not a new phenomenon and is likely to continue in the future. While its influence may be comparatively weaker compared to that of the United States and Russia, China's successful mediation in brokering the Saudi-Iranian reconciliation has provided it with significant momentum. This success has enabled China's diplomacy to leverage its experience and expertise to address the world's longest-standing crisis, such as the Palestinian issue.
China's involvement reinforces its role and demonstrates its potential to actively contribute to regional matters. Furthermore, China's policy towards the Palestinian crisis, characterized by its support for Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, bolsters its stance.
Secondly, the current Palestinian reality has shown that ongoing division among its factions, especially following the recent tragic loss of political leader Ismail Haniyeh, leads to the loss of their existential battle against Israeli occupation. This situation necessitates reorganizing the Palestinian ranks and rebuilding their collective unity as a prerequisite for commencing any future negotiations regarding Gaza and the Palestinian cause as a whole. Fatah acknowledges that excluding Hamas from the equation is not feasible, as it recognizes the importance of having a unified voice that represents the Palestinian perspective.
Thirdly, Arab-Chinese relations are witnessing significant momentum across various fields and levels, making China's involvement in the central issue for the Arab world not only acceptable but also welcomed. This is especially true given China's steadfast stance against Israeli military actions and its support for the Palestinian position on establishing an independent state.
Fourthly, the international arena, marred by crises, conflicts, wars, and internal challenges within major countries, has exerted pressure on Palestinian parties to consider the Chinese initiative for unity. The absence of European involvement, driven by internal and inter-state crises and the rise of far-right movements, coupled with the American preoccupation during the presidential elections despite its bias towards Israel, and the Russian engagement in the battle with Ukraine and its presence in multiple areas, have collectively resulted in a diminished focus on the Palestinian issue.
However, the recent escalation since Oct. 7 has compelled some actors to reorient their attention to the Palestinian cause, with China leading the way, offering an international lifeline to the Palestinians through its unity initiative.
In light of these four implications, it can be said that the step towards a Chinese-brokered Palestinian reconciliation remains crucial not only for the Palestinian side but also for enhancing China's role in the region.
It is crucial for China to recognize the implications and requirements outlined above in order to ensure the success of this reconciliation effort. By understanding these dynamics, China can better navigate the initiative and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes, potentially leading to several regional transformations that could ease tensions and limit the expansion of conflicts, thereby protecting the interests of all parties involved.

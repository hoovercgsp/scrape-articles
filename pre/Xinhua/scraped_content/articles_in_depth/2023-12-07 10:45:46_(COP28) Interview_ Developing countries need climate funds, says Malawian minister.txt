DUBAI, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- "Talk shows are over now," Malawian Minister of Energy Ibrahim Matola has said here at the ongoing COP28 climate conference, urging developed countries to fulfill their promise on delivering climate funds.
Developed countries need to "walk the talk," the minister told Xinhua in a recent interview here, adding: "it's time to implement what we have agreed."
As major carbon emitters since the Industrial Revolution, developed countries bear historical responsibility and legal obligations to offer help to developing countries, the biggest victims of climate change.
At the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen, developed countries pledged to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars in climate finance every year by 2020. However, the promise has yet to be fulfilled.
Malawi, as a southern African country, has been severely affected by extreme weather and is prone to natural disasters such as droughts and floods.
Development in countries such as Malawi would minimize the impacts of climate change, Matola said.
"Once these countries have developed, there will be a greater need for electricity," he said, adding that they still need the funds that developed countries had promised.
China has invested a lot in education, innovation, science and technology, and the country has made significant progress, said the minister.
"What we need is also investment in our education system, and job creation for our youth," said Matola, adding that this would provide better living conditions for future generations.
COP28, or the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is being held here from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12.
One of the focal topics at the climate talks is to help developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and mitigate the damage caused by climate disasters. â–

BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- With glittery nails, natural makeup, and a sleek high ponytail, Chang Yuan presents a striking contrast to her triumphant skyward roar in the boxing ring after winning the women's 54kg gold at the Paris Olympic Games.
Securing a clear unanimous decision against Türkiye's Hatice Akbas, Chang clinched China's first-ever Olympic women's boxing title. "Winning this gold medal has been a tremendous encouragement for me personally and a significant boost for the promotion of boxing as a sport," Chang told Xinhua in a recent interview.
"Chinese boxing has made history this time, achieving the best results ever at the Paris Olympics with three golds and two silvers. The rising trend of Chinese boxing is tangible, and I hope it continues to improve," she added.
However, the path to Olympic gold was fraught with challenges. The semifinal against Pang Chol Mi of DPR Korea was what she called "the toughest match."
"My mental state was quite challenged because Pang is a long-standing rival. We seem to have an almost magnetic connection, facing each other at almost every major competition."
Facing her again in Paris, after Chang's victory at the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games and a defeat at last year's Hangzhou Asian Games, Chang admitted to feeling nervous. "Both the coach and I had thoroughly analyzed my opponent, but I was quite anxious at the time. After reviewing the footage the night before our encounter, I couldn't sleep. My mind was like a movie reel, endlessly replaying how to respond," Chang revealed.
"Once I stepped into the ring, though, it was just me and my determination. I fought like crazy in that match, completely immersed in my own world," said the 27-year-old. "While in the ring, my mind was clear, and I could recall the coach's strategies. But once the match ended, I couldn't remember anything."
Ultimately, Chang advanced to the final with a narrow 3-2 split decision. "It was the most intense nervousness I have experienced in my 15 years of boxing."
Born into a Chinese martial arts family, Chang was introduced to boxing at the age of 12 and quickly transitioned from taekwondo to the ring as she felt "boxing was so cool." Chang showed immense promise early in her career, and her rise was no accident. "In my youth, winning felt achievable, almost as if I were destined for greatness," she shared.
As she progressed through the ranks, Chang first earned recognition on the international stage during the 2014 Youth Olympic Games, where she took home gold. This victory helped solidify her ambition of one day standing atop the Olympic podium.
"I'd rather tell the whole world that I wanted to compete at the Olympic Games than keep it a secret. Announcing it served as both pressure and motivation," she recalled.
Attending the Rio Olympics as the sparring partner of London silver medalist Ren Cancan, Chang made her Olympic debut in Tokyo in the 51kg category - a strong tradition in China's women's boxing.
The pressure to perform and her personal goal of winning gold were huge. The emotional toll peaked during the Tokyo Olympics where she didn't advance to the semifinals, even contemplating leaving the sport. "There was a period when I thought I might give it up."
"It felt like a significant setback. I wasn't just disappointed in myself; I felt like I had let down everyone who believed in me," she admitted. During this introspective period, Chang took time off to reassess her motivations and reaffirm her commitment to boxing.
Returning to the national team later, Chang found renewed energy and focus. Under the guidance of new Cuban coaches who introduced a rigorous training regimen, she ramped up her preparations for the Paris Olympics. "They trained us hard, teaching us to embrace fatigue as a form of growth," Chang said, illustrating her transformative experience.
Amidst the grueling training and competitions, it was the surrounding community that kept Chang grounded. From her fellow athletes to the coaching and medical staff, the support system fostered an environment where vulnerability was met with encouragement. "In the national team, you are more than just an athlete; you become a family," Chang noted.
As she balances her life as an Olympic champion, Chang is keen on giving back to the sport that has defined her life. With initiatives like "Boxing into Schools," she aims to inspire young talents and promote boxing among children as it "feels like my responsibility."
In addition to her commitment to the sport, Chang has gracefully embraced her identity beyond the ring. "People often see me as an athlete, but I'm also a woman who enjoys some simple pleasures of life - shopping, dressing up, and being with friends," she revealed with a smile.
Looking ahead, Chang expressed her desire to compete in the Los Angeles Olympics, where she hopes to defend her title. "If I have the chance to compete and defend my crown, I promise to give it everything I have. I'm ready for the challenge," she said. ■

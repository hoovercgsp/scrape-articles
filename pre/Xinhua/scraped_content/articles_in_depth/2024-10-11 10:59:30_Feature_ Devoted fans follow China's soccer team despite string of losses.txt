ADELAIDE, Australia, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- For Xiao Du, a devoted fan of China's national soccer team, following his team has become a way of life - no matter the cost or the outcome.
To watch China face Australia in a World Cup qualifier, Xiao Du embarked on a grueling 34-hour journey, flying from Beijing to Shanghai, then to Sydney, and finally to Adelaide.
On October 10, Xiao Du watched as China fell 3-1 to Australia at Adelaide Oval. It marked China's fourth consecutive defeat in the World Cup Asian qualifiers, following earlier losses to South Korea, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. With no points from three games in the third qualifying phase, China remains at the bottom of Group C.
At 30 years old, Xiao Du said the trip cost him nearly 30,000 yuan (about 4,500 U.S. dollars), but he wasn't deterred. "I was already prepared for China to lose," he said. "Is it worth it? That depends on how much you want it. If you don't want it, even a short trip feels far. But if you do, even Antarctica feels close."
Xiao Du isn't alone in his passion. Despite China's underwhelming performances, the team enjoys steadfast support from a loyal fan base. At the match, an older fan dressed in a red "Dragon Team" jersey voiced frustration over China's lack of aggression in their 7-0 loss to Japan. Yet, like Xiao Du, he had traveled an equally long and costly journey from Zhengzhou to back his team.
Supporting China's national team is more than an emotional challenge; it's a logistical one. Complicated visa processes and vast distances have kept many fans from attending matches in person. Still, hours before the game, groups of Chinese supporters gathered outside the stadium, clad in their signature red jerseys, chanting and cheering. Most were local Chinese residents or students from across Australia.
"I came from Perth; we're going all in tonight!" one fan exclaimed.
"I'm from Sydney. No matter the result, as long as it's the Chinese team, we're behind them," another added.
"I'm from Melbourne. We Chinese fans will always stand by our football team!" another declared proudly.
At the stadium's north gate, Mr. Di, a 12-year Australian resident originally from Inner Mongolia, draped himself in a Chinese flag, ready to cheer for his homeland. Though he has lived abroad for years, he said, "my heart is still Chinese," and he makes it a point to attend any match involving the Chinese team.
A stand-up comedian based in Melbourne, Di drove eight hours to Adelaide for the game. An avid soccer fan, he sported a 2015 edition of China's national team jersey and spoke animatedly about his love for the sport. He even joked about crafting a comedy routine inspired by his soccer adventures.
Inside the stadium, hundreds of Chinese fans, dressed in red and waving national flags, cheered relentlessly from the stands. They supported their team from the moment warm-ups began until the final whistle.
Xiao Xu, who grew up in Adelaide and now leads a local Chinese fan club, went the extra mile by purchasing flags and jerseys to hand out for free to fellow supporters. "The Chinese team is going through tough times, but our passion never changes," he said. "When we lose, we endure it together. When we win, we celebrate together."
More than 46,000 fans packed Adelaide Oval for the match, with Chinese supporters sprinkled among Australian fans. Some of the Chinese supporters were born in Australia but still maintain strong ties to their heritage.
Mr. Hui and his wife brought their two sons from Sydney. Their younger son, sporting a Chinese team jersey and waving a Chinese flag, was more comfortable speaking English than Mandarin. "Even though our son is an Australian citizen, his heart is still with China, and of course, he supports the Chinese team," Hui's wife explained.
Five-year-old Donne, who traveled with her mother from Perth, proudly proclaimed that her favorite player is Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei. Meanwhile, four-year-old Jiu Jiu, still too young to understand the game, was brought by his father, Mr. Li, in hopes of passing down his "soccer genes" from their hometown of Dalian.
As the final whistle blew and China's 3-1 loss was confirmed, fans slowly began to trickle out of the stadium. However, for many Chinese supporters, the emotional toll lingered.
"This match was a loss, but we played with heart," said Xiao Xu. "The team didn't give up, even when we were behind. Australia is stronger than us, but this was an acceptable loss. The team played to their potential."
Tears welled up in Xiao Du's eyes as he reflected on China's winless campaign. "We've lost three matches now, and I know many fans are disappointed, wondering why we haven't picked up any points. But realistically, out of six teams, we only have a chance of beating Bahrain or Indonesia. There's no need to be too upset. When you support the Chinese team, even if you know the likely outcome, you still want to be there, hoping for a miracle, right?"
Xiao's journey wasn't over. The following morning, he began the long trek back to China, with his first stop in Changsha for work. Five days later, he'll be in Qingdao, once again cheering for his team as they take on Indonesia.
"As children of China, we must always stand behind them, selflessly and without regret, because they represent us," he said. â–

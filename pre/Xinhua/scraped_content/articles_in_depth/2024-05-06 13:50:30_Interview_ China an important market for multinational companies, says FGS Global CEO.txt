ST. GALLEN, Switzerland, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China is a crucial market for multinational companies given its remarkable achievements in the last decades, Alexander Geiser, the CEO of FGS Global, has said.
FGS Global is a public relations company focusing on crisis management, government affairs, corporate reputation and capital markets communication with 1,300 employees and 30 offices, including one in Beijing and Shanghai.
"What China has done and accomplished over the last 30 years is unrivaled. We've never seen a nation that has been so successful in creating wealth in such a short period of time," Geiser told Xinhua on the sidelines of the 53rd St. Gallen Symposium in Switzerland.
The St. Gallen Symposium is a student-driven organization and platform for cross-generational dialogue and collaboration. This year's symposium, which was held from May 2 to 3 under the theme "Confronting Scarcity," brought together more than 100 speakers, 500 student volunteers and 1,200 participants.
"China is a very important market for us. For multinational companies going into China and Chinese companies that want to sell in global markets, helping them build their reputation in world markets is a growing business for us," said Geiser.
"We are now in a phase where China is finding its place in the world economy and trying to find a balance with everybody else. I sincerely hope that we do find a balance because that's a win-win situation for everybody," he said.
On April 29, the International Monetary Fund raised its growth estimate for China this year to 4.6 percent, up by 0.4 percentage points.
"Optimism is critical," Geiser said. "Everybody here at the conference can make a difference, whether you are a next-generation leader or a current-generation leader. Leadership will need more optimism and positive projects to pursue." â–

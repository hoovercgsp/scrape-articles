TASHKENT, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 75 years, China has overcome historical challenges on its development path to become one of the world's major powers today, an Uzbek scholar has said.
The Chinese model of progress is a unique combination of socialism and market principles, which allows China to remain an economic power, said Azamat Seitov, a scholar at Uzbekistan's University of World Economy and Diplomacy, in an interview with Xinhua.
"China's great achievements are not only in economic growth but also in advances in social policy, infrastructure, and technology," he said.
China, he said, has managed to find a model that ensures both growth and stability.
"The two main 'miracles' are rapid economic growth and lasting stability, which are unique for a country with such a large population and in the face of global challenges," Seitov said.
"This experience has a global impact, offering developing countries an alternative to the Western approach to development. The global significance of China's political model lies in its ability to influence world economic and political processes, shift the balance of power, and open new avenues for international cooperation," he said.
Seitov pointed out that China's contribution to global governance amid the world's challenges is multifaceted.
"It includes not only economic and financial influence but also intellectual contributions, as well as the initiation of several major projects aimed at addressing many issues in the global community, particularly in Central Asian countries, including Uzbekistan," he added. â–

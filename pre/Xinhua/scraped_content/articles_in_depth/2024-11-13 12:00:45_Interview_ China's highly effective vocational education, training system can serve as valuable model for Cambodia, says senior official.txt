PHNOM PENH, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a highly effective vocational education and training (VET) system, which can serve as a valuable model for Cambodia, Om Romny, secretary of state of Cambodia's Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday.
VALUABLE MODEL FOR CAMBODIA'S VET SYSTEM
China's success is rooted in several key strategies and reforms, he said, adding that China's focus on hands-on training through specialized practice centers has improved vocational education by bridging the gap between theory and real-world skills.
"Cambodia could benefit by investing in similar centers to enhance its VET programs," Romny said.
He added that China's education system emphasizes a holistic approach, combining moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, and labor education to develop well-rounded students with strong values, adaptability, and vocational skills.
"Cambodia could adopt a similar model to enhance its students' competencies beyond technical skills," he said. "China's ongoing VET reforms align education with economic needs, ensuring vocational training stays relevant to evolving industries."
The official said Cambodia aims to learn from this experience and focus on reforms that support its goal of becoming a regional manufacturing and service hub.
Cambodia's VET system offers formal and non-formal programs to meet diverse educational needs, he said, adding that by learning from China's approach, Cambodia can better support youth and adult learners and improve employability across sectors.
"Cambodia can strengthen its VET system by leveraging China's successful strategies in practice-oriented training, comprehensive education, and adaptive reforms," Romny said.
"The collaboration aligns well with Cambodia's goals to produce skilled human capital, boost economic development, and increase regional competitiveness, especially within the Belt and Road Initiative framework," he added.
CHINA KEY TO FUTURE OF CAMBODIA'S VET SECTOR
Romny said as Cambodia's largest trading partner, China is pivotal to the future of the kingdom's VET sector.
"Through cooperation in vocational education, we can drive socio-economic progress in Cambodia and within the broader Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region," he said.
Key areas of collaboration include capacity building and knowledge exchange, he said, adding that China's advanced technical training frameworks and experience in implementing successful VET programs can help Cambodia develop a more robust VET system.
"Collaborative projects in infrastructure, equipment, and funding will enable us to build and upgrade vocational training facilities, making high-quality technical education more accessible," he said.
Romny added that expanding scholarships and training exchanges will allow Cambodian students and professionals to gain valuable skills in China and apply this knowledge to the Cambodian workforce.
"With strengthened China-Cambodia cooperation, we anticipate creating a more resilient and skilled workforce, which will drive Cambodia's socio-economic development and fortify our position in the global market," he said. "This partnership supports our vision of transforming Cambodia into a hub for skilled labor in ASEAN, building a foundation for sustainable growth."
CURRENT SITUATION OF VET DEVELOPMENT IN CAMBODIA
Romny said Cambodia's VET system is at a pivotal stage of development and that the country strives to modernize its education sector to align with economic goals.
He added that the kingdom recognizes that a skilled workforce is essential for long-term growth and competitiveness.
"However, the current situation reflects challenges such as limited training facilities, outdated curricula, and a mismatch between skills taught and market demands," he said. "Many young Cambodians are entering the workforce without the specific technical skills needed in growing industries, which impacts productivity and limits economic opportunities."
The official said VET is crucial in bridging skill gaps in Cambodia by aligning education with labor market needs.
"As the country shifts from agriculture to higher-value sectors, strengthening VET will help build a more adaptable, productive workforce to support emerging industries and attract foreign investment," he said.
Romny said Cambodia's Pentagonal Strategy prioritizes education and human capital development to build a knowledge-based economy.
He added that it focuses on enhancing technical and vocational skills through partnerships with international institutions, the private sector, and the government to improve VET quality and accessibility.
"Cambodia's VET policies align with economic growth goals, addressing skill gaps and boosting resilience," he said. "Efforts focus on improving training infrastructure, updating curricula to meet industry needs, expanding education access to rural and urban areas, and supporting economic growth, industry diversification, and poverty reduction."
Romny's comments were made ahead of the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference, which will be held in Tianjin, North China on Nov. 20-22. â–

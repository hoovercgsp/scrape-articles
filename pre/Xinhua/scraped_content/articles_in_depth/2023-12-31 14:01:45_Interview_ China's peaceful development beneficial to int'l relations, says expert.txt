ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- China's international policy based on peaceful development has a positive impact on international relations, an expert has said.
China is committed to governing the country with virtue and peacefully engaging with other countries, said Irina Popova, director of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in an interview with Xinhua.
Western countries, by contrast, believe in hegemonic aggression, said the sinologist.
Throughout history, Western international relations theories paid little attention to Asian countries. Even today, a belief in the superiority of Western civilization continues to influence the foreign policy of Western countries. This often results in the forceful imposition of Western values on a global scale, Popova added.
"China is moving to the center of the world stage and occupies a leading position in global influence in many aspects, such as international affairs and economics," said Popova, adding that China works to strengthen multipolarity in international relations, which meets the interests of many other countries.
According to the expert, most Western countries and civilizations have waged war throughout history. "They have grown their own military strength at the expense of other countries' interests."
Popova believes that initiatives like the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative have resulted in mutual benefits for both China and the countries involved, given the initiative's focus on joint development, harmony and cooperation.
"China has a profound history and culture and is a real treasure trove of wisdom, including in the sphere of government and management," Popova said. "This wisdom allows the Chinese authorities to pursue a balanced policy that meets the interests of global development." â–

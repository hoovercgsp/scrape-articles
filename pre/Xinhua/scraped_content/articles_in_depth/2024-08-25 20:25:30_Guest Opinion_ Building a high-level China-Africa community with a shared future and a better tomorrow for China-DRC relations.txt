For more than half a century, China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have supported each other in the struggle for national emancipation and in achieving their national development and recovery. The two countries have continuously strengthened their traditional friendship and engaged in fruitful cooperation across various fields. In May 2023, DRC President Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo paid a state visit to China, which was considered a great success.
During this visit, the leaders of the two countries jointly decided to upgrade the China-DRC relations to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. Under the joint leadership of the two heads of state, both sides have continually strengthened their exchanges and cooperation within the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), resulting in new advancements in China-DRC relations.
First, political trust between the two countries has become stronger. For over a year, the two heads of state have maintained close communication through various means and jointly outlined the future of China-DRC relations. In the past year, the DRC has seen the re-election of President Tshisekedi and the successful establishment of new state organs. Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping and Vice Chairperson of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Shen Yueyue attended President Tshisekedi's inauguration ceremony in Kinshasa, and Chinese state leaders sent congratulatory messages to their DRC counterparts upon their election or appointment.
This reflects the great importance China places on bilateral relations. The Chinese and DRC governments, political parties, and legislative bodies have worked to strengthen their ties and make full use of FOCAC, the most important platform for China-Africa cooperation, to strengthen the exchange of state governance experiences, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and pool efforts to consolidate and develop the China-DRC friendship.
Second, practical cooperation between the two countries has become more fruitful. Both sides have strengthened the coordination of their development strategies and worked together to achieve high-level cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative.
There is a lot of positive news about China-DRC cooperation in infrastructure, industry, trade, economy, and social welfare. Important projects completed last year, such as the Kinsuka Power Station, the Busanga Hydropower Station, the Saphir Ceramics factory in Maluku, and the Sakania Dry Port, have injected strong momentum into the industrial development of the DRC. This year, several major projects under the China-DRC "resource for projects" cooperation package have begun, from Kinshasa to Lualaba, passing through the Grand Kasai, providing considerable support to the DRC in strengthening its connectivity.
In the first half of 2024, trade between China and the DRC reached 12.34 billion U.S. dollars, and the DRC has become a leading destination for Chinese investment in Africa. Chinese companies in the DRC remain committed to the principle of shared benefits and actively work to support local community development, such as the construction of "demonstration rural development villages," so that local residents can benefit from the tangible achievements of China-DRC cooperation and, more broadly, China-Africa cooperation.
Third, people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become more frequent. Under the Global Civilization Initiative, both sides have organized numerous cultural activities such as the "Chinese Film Week," where think tanks, scholars, and media have increased exchanges and actively explored expanding their cooperation.
Since the beginning of 2024, China has provided over 200 training opportunities in China for DRC officials in various fields to support the DRC in talent development and youth growth. The Confucius Institute, jointly established by both sides, is becoming increasingly popular among DRC youth. I would like to highlight that the Central African Cultural and Arts Center, whose construction has just finished after five years, has become a new symbol of China-DRC friendly cooperation and will serve as an important platform for strengthening China-DRC and China-Africa cultural exchanges.
Fourth, mutual support between the two countries has become stronger. On the issue regarding the eastern DRC, China has consistently stood firmly on the side of fairness and justice. China actively works for peace by encouraging dialogue among the different parties. Chinese peacekeepers have notably fulfilled their mission within the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), which has been highly praised by Congolese authorities. For its part, the DRC has always resolutely adhered to the one-China principle. The two sides have maintained close coordination in multilateral affairs to jointly safeguard the common interests of developing countries.
Currently, China is committed to a new phase of deepening reform in all areas to promote Chinese modernization, while the new state organs of the DRC are working to realize the six "major commitments" initiated by President Tshisekedi.
China-DRC relations are at a new historical starting point with promising prospects. The new session of the FOCAC Summit will soon open in Beijing, where guests from various African countries will discuss China-Africa cooperation. I am confident that Chinese and African leaders will reach new consensus on the theme "Joining Hands to Advance Modernization and Build a High-Level China-Africa Community with a Shared Future" during this summit.
This will set new directions for the development of global cooperation and the China-DRC strategic partnership, and create new prospects for China and the DRC to develop and progress together.

1. FIRST OF ITS KIND
This event, pivotal for qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, includes competitions in BMX freestyle, breaking, skateboarding, and sport climbing. It will take place from May 16 to 19, marking the first instance where athletes from these four sports will compete together at the same venue in a single urban park.

Specifically, athletes in BMX freestyle, breaking, and sport climbing are competing for a total of 100 points, split equally between Shanghai and the second part of the OQS in Budapest, with a maximum of 50 points available at each event.
For skateboarding, one-third of the final ranking points are derived from previous competitions, with the events in Shanghai and Budapest contributing equally to the remaining two-thirds.
2. STARS TO WATCH
This high-stakes competition features 81 previous Olympians, including 18 who earned medals at Tokyo 2020. Notable competitors include defending BMX freestyle Olympic champions Logan Martin from Australia and Charlotte Worthington from Britain.

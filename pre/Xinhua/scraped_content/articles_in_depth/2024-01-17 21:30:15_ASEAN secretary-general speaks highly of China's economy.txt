JAKARTA, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is important to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the world, said ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn here on Wednesday, referring to China's economic achievements in 2023.
Kao Kim Hourn made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.
"Between ASEAN and China, we continue to see trade growth, and we see investment coming from China. We look forward to more cooperation between ASEAN and China, particularly in all areas of the ASEAN economy, including for example, we hope that China continues to import more from ASEAN countries, including agriculture products," Kao Kim Hourn said.
The strong economy of China will be very important for the development of the region and of the world, he added. â–

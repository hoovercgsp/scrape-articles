ZANZIBAR, Tanzania, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 4,579 people have contracted the red eye disease in Tanzania's Zanzibar since the outbreak of the ailment two weeks ago, an official said on Tuesday.
Zanzibari Deputy Minister of Health Hassan Khamis Hafidh said the cases of the red eye disease were collected from health centers and government and private hospitals on Unguja and Pemba Islands.
Hafidh told a news conference at his office that the disease, which causes eye redness most often due to swollen or dilated blood vessels, was spread in Zanzibar by travelers from mainland Tanzania.
He urged people suffering from the disease to stop treating themselves with traditional medicines, saying there was no proven cure for the illness.
On Jan. 16, Tanzanian health authorities issued a high alert over the outbreak of the disease, noting preliminary investigations have shown that many people have contracted the disease in the country.
Pascal Ruggajo, director of Curative Services in the Ministry of Health, said remedies for red eye are wide-ranging, including gently washing eyelids and lightly massaging them, adding that eye care specialists may recommend and prescribe medicines. â–

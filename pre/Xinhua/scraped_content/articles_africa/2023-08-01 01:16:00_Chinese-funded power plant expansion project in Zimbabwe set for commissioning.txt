HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Energy and Power Development Minister Soda Zhemu said here on Monday that prolonged power cuts are "now a thing of the past" in Zimbabwe following the completion of Hwange Thermal Power Station Unit 7 and 8 expansion project.
Chinese firm Sinohydro undertook the project, adding 600 MW to Hwange Thermal Power Station, the country's largest coal-fired power plant.
The project will be commissioned by President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Thursday.
Zhemu said at a press conference that recent media reports predicting a return to prolonged power cuts after August were false, as Zimbabwe is now guaranteed adequate power supplies in the short-to-medium term.
He said Unit 7 is already feeding into the grid after the successful completion of tests in June and is now commercially available for operation. Unit 8 is also undergoing a similar test and is expected to be available commercially by August or September this year.
"So there is no way that we are going back to the past where we used to experience long hours of load shedding," Zhemu added. â–

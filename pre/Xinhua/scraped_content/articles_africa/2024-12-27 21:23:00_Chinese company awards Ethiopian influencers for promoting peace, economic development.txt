ADDIS ABABA, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese textile company Antex Group on Thursday awarded prominent Ethiopian personalities in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, for their contributions to promoting peace and socio-economic development in the country.
The inaugural Best Influencer Works Prize, the first of its kind in Ethiopia that aims at fostering peaceful economic development, recognized Ethiopian figures for their significant efforts in encouraging harmonious coexistence among various communities, as well as notable business leaders for their role in advancing the nation's economic growth.
Addressing the ceremony, Antex Group Chairman Qian Anhua said that the peace and economy awards aim to share China's best practices and experiences with Ethiopia as the East African nation strives for peaceful socio-economic development.
Mesebet Shenkute, president of the Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral Associations, praised the Chinese textile company for its commendable corporate social responsibility efforts by supporting local communities and promoting peaceful development in Ethiopia. She emphasized that this recognition would inspire more Ethiopian individuals and organizations to engage in similar exemplary activities.
A group of community leaders from the Gamo people of Ethiopia, commonly known as "Gamo elders," who have recently won the hearts of Ethiopians for their humble efforts in promoting peaceful coexistence among ethnic groups, received the peace prize along with a financial award of 10 million birr (about 80,000 U.S. dollars).
Bejai Naiker, a young Ethiopian entrepreneur recognized for providing engineering solutions and training thousands of young locals in the engineering sector, was awarded the economy prize, including a 10-million-birr financial award, for his contributions to job creation, innovation, and talent development.
Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia Xue Wei said that the initiative not only acknowledges the efforts of Ethiopian individuals and organizations in national development but also underscores the importance of both individual and collective contributions to achieving peace and progress.
Antex, which specializes in producing export-oriented textile products at the Chinese-built Adama Industrial Park, is a key player in Ethiopia's manufacturing industry. â–

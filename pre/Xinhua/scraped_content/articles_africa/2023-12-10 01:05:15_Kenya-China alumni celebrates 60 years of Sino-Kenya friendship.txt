Henry Rotich, the chairperson of Kenya-China Alumni Association, said that Kenya-China friendship is a testament to the resilience of a partnership that has weathered challenges and flourished through collaboration, mutual respect and shared aspirations.
Rotich observed that over the years, the alumni have grown to over 1,500 members and is an indicator of how much Kenyans believe in the quality of education in China.
He revealed that China is an attractive destination for Kenyans seeking higher education because the Asian nation is also a developing country that is facing similar challenges.

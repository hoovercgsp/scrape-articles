KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The head coach of Uganda's rugby 7s team, Tolbert Onyango, has warned that it will not be easy facing China during the final 2024 Olympic Games qualifier in Monaco.
World Rugby placed Uganda alongside China, Britain and Canada in Group B during the draw conducted on April 20 for the Olympic Games Repechage tournament at Stade Louis II in Monaco between June 21 and 23.
Onyango told Xinhua that it will not be an easy task because every team will be hungry to qualify for the Paris Olympics.
"We know what to expect, but facing a team like China is very tricky because they are a much improved team that is very tactical," added Onyango.
The head coach made it clear that although playing at the African Games in Ghana, where they won gold, gave them a good ground to test the team with several matches, they will need to prepare well for the qualifier in Monaco. "All the teams that we are to play have very different approaches and style of play," added Onyango.
Kenya is the only African team to have already secured qualification for the Paris Olympics rugby men's category thanks to its ranking in the 2023 World Rugby Sevens Series. â–

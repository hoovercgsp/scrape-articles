CAIRO, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a pivotal development initiative in favour of all, said an Egyptian expert.
"The BRI is extremely important for humanity, not just for China," said Diaa Helmy, an Egyptian expert on Chinese affairs, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
Over the past decade, the initiative has made a positive impact on developing countries by upgrading infrastructure in partner states, especially those in Africa and Asia, said Helmy, secretary-general of the Cairo-based Egyptian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
Proposed by China in 2013, the BRI can be described as "the initiative of the century" or "the initiative of modern human history," said the Egyptian expert, adding that it has greatly boosted cooperation among participating states in the face of various challenges.
"The success of the initiative can be seen in its growing popularity and the increasing cooperation among BRI states," he said.
The initiative is vital for developing economies in general, particularly those in Africa, and is expected to lead them "to broad horizons of development, progress and prosperity," said the expert.
He pointed out that amid growing conflicts and tensions worldwide, the BRI seeks win-win partnerships and common development among participating countries.
Noting that Egypt was one of six countries officially invited to join BRICS, he said cooperation between Egypt and China has been on the rise in recent years and is to reach new horizons in the near future.
Egypt and China can work together for the development of Africa through the localization of Chinese advanced industries and the transfer of Chinese technologies to the continent, according to Helmy.
With its potential market and strategic status, Egypt can be a regional hub for the localization of Chinese technologies and industries, and become a key bridge connecting China, Africa and the Arab world under the BRI framework, he added. â–

KAMPALA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's women's badminton team has promised to make a good impression and perform well when they take part in the 2024 Uber Cup to take place in China.
Uganda will be making their maiden appearance at the 2024 Thomas & Uber Cup slated for April 28th to May 5th in Chengdu, China. The Ugandan team is placed in Group C together with Japan, Indonesia and Hong Kong, China.
Simon Mugabi, the Chief Executive Officer of the Uganda Badminton Association (UBA) told Xinhua before he traveled to China on Tuesday night that the team is motivated to impress in Chengdu.
"This will be a very good experience for our young women's team who also performed well at the African Games in Ghana that ended in March. It is very good to go and get that big exposure with the top players at the Uber Cup," explained Mugabi.
He further explained that although the four women players have failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics after featuring in tournaments in Spain, France and Slovenia, they put up good performances in their pursuit of points to make the qualification grade.
Husinah Kobugabe who won a silver medal in the women's singles at the African Games told Xinhua that they are not going to China just to participate, but to compete against the best players in the world. "We are not intimidated in any way because we have been facing some of these top players in other tournaments," added Kobugabe.
Gladys Mbabazi, Fadilah Shamika and Tracy Naluwooza are the other players who will make up Uganda's team.
It will be Uganda's first time to appear in the Uber Cup after South Africa who had initially qualified for the African continent withdrew. â–

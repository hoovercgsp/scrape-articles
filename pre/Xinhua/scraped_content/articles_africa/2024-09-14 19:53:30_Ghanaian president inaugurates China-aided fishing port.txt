ACCRA, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on Friday inaugurated a China-aided fishing port complex in Jamestown, a coastal community in Accra, the nation's capital.
Constructed by CRCC Harbor and Channel Engineering Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese firm, the Jamestown Fishing Port Complex features a range of facilities, including a two-story office building, a fish market, an ice-making plant, shops, cold storage, a kindergarten, a fire station and a ship repair station.
During the commissioning ceremony, Akufo-Addo expressed his delight at the project's completion, saying it will bolster Jamestown's fishing industry and reduce post-harvest losses.
"The government prioritized this project due to the important role artisanal fishing plays in Ghana's economy and the livelihoods of the people," Akufo-Addo said. He noted that the new port will create jobs, stimulate the local economy and transform the fishing community.
"It will inject new energy into the heart of this community, with ripple effects across the entire nation," he said.
The president also expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for its longstanding support of Ghana, including its assistance with the harbor project and other key infrastructure developments.
Chinese Ambassador to Ghana Tong Defa officially handed over the port complex, affirming China's commitment to supporting Ghana's socio-economic progress.
"It is a significant infrastructure project aimed at boosting Ghana's fishing industry, enhancing local economic development, and improving the livelihoods of local communities that rely on fishing," Tong said. He said that China considers its solidarity and cooperation with African nations, including Ghana, a cornerstone of its foreign policy.
The project is a symbol of the two nations' joint efforts toward modernization, and a testament to the Global South's confidence in unity and collaboration, Tong said. â–

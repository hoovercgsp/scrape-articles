DAR ES SALAAM, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Tanzania held a reception Tuesday night to celebrate the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which falls on Oct. 1.
Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania Chen Mingjian expressed her gratitude to all the friends who have been consistent contributors to the friendship between China and Tanzania.
China has remained Tanzania's largest trading partner for seven consecutive years, with bilateral trade reaching 8.31 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, Chen said, noting that China is also the largest source of foreign investment in Tanzania.
"This day marks a significant milestone in the history of China and its people, as well as in the relations between our two great nations," said Tanzanian Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Minister January Makamba.
"Over the years, China's rapid economic growth has made a tremendous contribution to global prosperity, economic stability, and recovery," he told current and retired government officials, ambassadors, high commissioners, and heads of international organizations gathered at the Chinese embassy in Dar es Salaam.
"Tanzania reiterates its commitment to continue supporting the (Belt and Road) Initiative and participate in its relevant activities," said Tanzania's top diplomat. â–

NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The China (Anhui)-Kenya Economic and Trade Conference was held on Thursday in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi to promote trade relations between the two sides.
The event attracted a high-level delegation from east China's Anhui Province, senior Kenyan government officials, and representatives of about 50 local enterprises keen to partner with Chinese counterparts.
Juma Mukhwana, principal secretary in the Ministry of Investments, Trade and Industry, said Kenya offers diverse economic opportunities for Chinese investors due to its strategic location as a gateway to the East African Community and the wider African market.
"So far, 18 counties have set up industrial parks that offer world-class facilities for Chinese investors to process raw materials into finished goods for both domestic and international markets," Mukhwana said.
He noted that the Chinese delegation's visit underscores the deepening ties between the two countries and the immense potential for mutually beneficial cooperation.
Shan Xiangqian, vice-governor of Anhui Province, said the delegation has traveled more than 9,000 kilometers with the sincerity of carrying forward the China-Africa friendship.
Shan added that Chinese investment will benefit Kenya by creating jobs and transferring technology to improve local industrial capacity.
Florence Benta Were, managing director of Kenya Investment Authority, said Kenya has established special economic zones to facilitate the flow of investment from foreign investors.
Were noted that the synergies between Kenya's abundant resources and Anhui Province's industrial expertise will result in numerous advantages for both countries. â–

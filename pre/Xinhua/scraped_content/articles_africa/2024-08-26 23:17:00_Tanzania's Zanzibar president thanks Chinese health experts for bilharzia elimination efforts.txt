DAR ES SALAAM, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Zanzibari President Hussein Ali Mwinyi on Monday thanked a Chinese medical team for their contributions to controlling and eliminating schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, in Zanzibar.
Speaking at a farewell reception at the Zanzibari State House for the Chinese health experts at the end of the China-aided schistosomiasis prevention and control project in Zanzibar, Mwinyi said the project has helped the most vulnerable groups in the region.
He noted that the project also improved Zanzibar's disease prevention and control system and will further deepen the friendship between China and Zanzibar.
Mwinyi expressed gratitude to China for its selfless assistance to Zanzibar in the medical and public health sector over the years.
Zanzibar's Minister for Health Nassor Ahmed Mazrui said that with the help of Chinese experts, Zanzibar has established a schistosomiasis prevention and control model based on community hospitals and community health volunteers, improved disease prevention and control capabilities, and trained schistosomiasis professionals and technical personnel.
"The Chinese expert team's friendship in saving lives and healing the wounded and their boundless love will forever be engraved in the hearts of the people of Zanzibar," said Mazrui.
Huang Yuzheng, leader of the Chinese medical team, said he looks forward to receiving strong support from the Zanzibar government in the implementation of the next project. â–

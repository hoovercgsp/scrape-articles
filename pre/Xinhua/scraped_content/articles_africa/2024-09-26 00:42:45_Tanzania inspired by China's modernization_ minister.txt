DAR ES SALAAM, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian authorities on Tuesday night congratulated China on the upcoming 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which falls on Oct. 1 each year.
"Indeed, this is a reflection on the journey that brought us here and a reminder of our shared history, friendship, as well as the aspirations that continue to define our diplomatic relations," said Palamagamba Kabudi, Tanzania's minister of constitutional and legal affairs.
Speaking at a reception party to celebrate the anniversary at the Chinese embassy in the port city of Dar es Salaam, Kabudi said Tanzania is inspired by the modernization of China and its significant transformations on the global stage.
Since its founding in 1949, the PRC has undergone profound economic, social, and political changes, moving from an agrarian society to one of the world's leading industrial and technological powers, said the minister.
"Over the past 75 years, China has made tremendous achievements in economic growth, poverty reduction, urbanization, and infrastructure as well as in space and science," Kabudi told diplomats from various countries and senior government officials invited to the reception.
He reiterated the Tanzanian government's commitment to strengthening relations with China in all aspects and supporting China on various issues of common interest at bilateral and multilateral levels, aiming to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
"Tanzania will continue to take dedicated practical steps to reflect the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership status of our relations," said Kabudi. â–

KINSHASA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 students were awarded on Thursday the "Mulan Scholarship," a program launched by the Chinese Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2022 to empower young Congolese girls through education.
Named after a legendary Chinese heroine, the "Mulan Scholarship" has been dedicated to advancing women's education and development in the DRC since its inception. Chinese Ambassador Zhao Bin said that 72 female students have benefited from the scholarship.
The ambassador said that the embassy has been dedicated to promoting mutual understanding between the Chinese and Congolese people, noting the encouraging progress in supporting the development of young Congolese women.
Thoa Tsambu Gisele, who represented the DRC's minister of higher education, expressed gratitude for the opportunities China has created for young Congolese women through the scholarship. She praised China for offering the DRC a "proactive and beneficial model of cooperation" across various sectors, including education and the empowerment of women.
"China has consistently demonstrated its friendship and solidarity with nations in need," Gisele said.
Jean-Marie Kayembe Ntumba, the rector of the University of Kinshasa, encouraged the scholarship recipients to excel in their studies, honor their country, and become ambassadors for Sino-Congolese friendship. â–

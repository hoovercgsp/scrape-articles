Gitonga Maringa, Huawei Kenya's senior information technology (IT) solutions manager, said at a briefing in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi that the IdealHub range of products digitizes classrooms to introduce interactive teaching and immersive learning for students of all ages.
"Our hardware platform is equipped with high-performance computing technology with tools that enable hybrid learning for students, even those in remote locations," said Maringa.

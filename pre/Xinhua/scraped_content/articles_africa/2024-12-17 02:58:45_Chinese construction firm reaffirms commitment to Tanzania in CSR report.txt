DAR ES SALAAM, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- China Railway Jianchang Engineering Company (CRJE) (East Africa) Limited in Tanzania released its corporate social responsibility (CSR) report on Monday, stressing its dedication to becoming a responsible corporate entity and positively impacting the growing Tanzania-China partnership.

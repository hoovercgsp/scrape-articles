WINDHOEK, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Elizabeth Simboti, a vibrant 60-year-old woman from Mbora Village in Namibia's rural Kavango East region, vividly recalls the immense challenges she once faced in her goat-selling business. Poor road conditions in her remote village of 200 households made it nearly impossible for buyers to access her livestock, leaving her dreams of growth stifled.
"In the past, customers couldn't reach us because of the terrible roads," Simboti told Xinhua during a recent visit. The region's sandy, underdeveloped roads often became impassable during the rainy season, crippling economic activities and isolating communities like hers.
A turning point came when the China Henan International Cooperation Group (CHICO) began upgrading the region's roads from sand to gravel as part of the Namibian government's initiative to enhance transport infrastructure, bringing new hope to communities like Mbora.
"Now cars, even taxis, can move easily," Simboti said. The upgraded roads have transformed her business -- livestock prices have risen, transportation costs have dropped, and buyers can now access the village directly, eliminating the need for her laborious trips to distant markets.
The improved infrastructure has also eased mobility for residents like Sikongo Kakondo, principal of Mbora Primary School. "Previously, only 4x4 vehicles in excellent condition could navigate the roads. Now, even small sedans can reach the school, sparing teachers from parking far away," he said.
The better roads have also attracted new visitors and potential settlers, further energizing the local economy, Kakondo added.
In Ndama, a peri-urban area near Rundu, the capital of Kavango East, residents have similarly reaped the benefits of road upgrades. Martin Elias, a local resident, noted that public transport now reaches homes easily, enhancing both safety and accessibility.
CHICO, active in Namibia since 2007, has earned accolades for its infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and railways, as well as for creating thousands of jobs for Namibians.
Sakaria Shopati, strategic executive for Infrastructure, Planning, and Technical Services at the Rundu Town Council, commended CHICO's ongoing projects, such as upgrading the University of Namibia road from gravel to bitumen standards. "The first section is already completed, and overall progress is about 60 percent," Shopati said.
He also highlighted CHICO's efforts in upgrading 11 sandy roads, covering 13 km, to gravel standards in informal areas around Rundu. These roads, previously accessible only to 4x4 vehicles, posed significant challenges to the community. "We are striving to bring essential services closer to the community," Shopati explained.
While noting that improved road infrastructure is critical for providing access to schools, clinics, and shopping centers, Shopati emphasized the council's commitment to job creation, with certain construction components, such as concrete and interlocking works, reserved for local small and medium-sized enterprises collaborating with CHICO.
Reflecting on the progress, Shopati said that three or four years ago, Rundu had some of the worst roads in the country. Even investors avoided the area due to poor infrastructure. Now, improved roads are attracting tourists and investors alike.
Currently, Rundu is one of the fastest-growing towns in Namibia and the second-largest by population.
CHICO has been an outstanding partner and they deliver quality work with minimal supervision and at an impressive pace, Shopati said. "We look forward to maintaining this harmonious relationship."
Namibia's Roads Authority, tasked with constructing and maintaining the country's road infrastructure, has partnered with CHICO through various agreements.
Kennedy Chigumira, regional engineering manager under the Network Maintenance Division for Roads Authority, praised CHICO's efficiency and adherence to timelines. "They sometimes finish projects ahead of schedule, enabling us to deliver services to communities faster," Chigumira noted.
According to the country's 2023 Population Census, the Kavango East region, with a population of 218,421, is experiencing significant growth, underscoring the need for continued infrastructure development to support its rapid growth.
Beyond road construction, CHICO has also invested in education and community development projects, further contributing to the region's progress and improving the quality of life for its residents. â–

GABORONE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is stepping up its marketing efforts to attract more Chinese tourists, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said Saturday.
During the official opening of the Motse Wa Setso cultural festival in Francistown, Botswana's second largest city, Masisi said that Chinese travelers rarely visit the southern African country, despite its many attractions for them.
"Botswana has a lot to offer to Chinese tourists," Masisi said at the cultural festival, whose name means "the village of culture."
Botswana, through the Botswana Tourism Organization (BTO) under the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, is planning to host Chinese tourism professionals in the near future, Masisi said. Additionally, the country is preparing to participate in several business expos in China this year to promote Botswana as a desirable destination.
Highlighting Botswana's unique attractions, Masisi emphasized the country's abundant wildlife, diverse landscapes and rich culture, which set it apart from other tourism destinations.
Despite receiving 248,220 international tourists in the second quarter of 2022, only 189 were Chinese visitors, according to Statistics Botswana, the country's statistical agency.
Masisi highlighted China's large population and expanding middle class, which has a growing interest in travel and significant purchasing power. Increased Chinese tourism to Botswana is expected to create additional job opportunities for the country's young population, which constitutes 60 percent of its estimated 2.3 million people. â–

NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President William Ruto on Friday participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Chinese-built Talanta Sports City in Nairobi, Kenya's capital.
Situated at Jamhuri Grounds in Nairobi, the Talanta Sports City will have a 60,000-seat FIFA standard professional football stadium to be constructed by China Road and Bridge Corporation. The project is slated for completion by the end of 2025 and will serve as a main venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as matches, of the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).
The transformative project aims to redefine Kenya's sporting profile, offering an iconic facility and infrastructural upgrade for both the city and the nation, Ruto said. He underscored Kenya's role as a co-host alongside Tanzania and Uganda for the 2027 AFCON, signaling the country's ambition to emerge as a regional, continental and global center for sports development and competition.
He also highlighted Kenya's concerted efforts in developing and implementing a comprehensive sports and creative industries infrastructure master plan, which aims to offer quality training facilities for the country's sportspeople while incubating and developing sporting talent nationwide.
The president's remarks struck a chord with attendees, including Joseph Orzo, football coach at Dagoretti Mixed Secondary School, and his young players, who were excited about the stadium's construction.
"Building the stadium is a great idea to harness the talents of the kids and provide more opportunities for talented players to grow," said Orzo.
During the groundbreaking ceremony, Ababu Namwamba, Kenya's cabinet secretary for Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports, underscored the stadium's integration of Kenyan cultural elements and its commitment to renewable energy, saying that once completed, the stadium will serve for football, rugby, concerts and various other events.
Jiao Xuxue, deputy general manager of China Road and Bridge Corporation Kenya Head Office, said that the stadium will serve as a key venue for public leisure, fitness and various cultural and recreational activities upon completion. Additionally, it will meet the requirements for hosting comprehensive and specialized sports events, providing sustained support for the development of the local entertainment and recreation industry. â–

LIBREVILLE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Since establishing diplomatic relations, Gabon and China have achieved win-win cooperation across various fields, with results beneficial to both peoples, Gabonese Minister of Foreign Affairs Regis Onanga Ndiaye said Friday.
Onanga made the remarks at a seminar marking the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations. More than 150 representatives attended the seminar, including Zhu Xiaole, charge d'affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Gabon, Gabonese Minister of Media and Communication Laurence Ndong, and Minister of Water and Forests Maurice Ntossui Allogo.
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the Gabon-China relations have been rich and dynamic, said Onanga, highlighting the decision of the two heads of state to elevate the relationship to that of a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership last year.
"The Gabonese government welcomes this level of cooperation with China, which in recent years has become one of the major players in the economic development of African countries," said Onanga, calling on both countries to reaffirm the South-South partnership for shared prosperity.
Delivering his speech at the event, Zhu noted the two economies are highly complementary, and China has been Gabon's largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years since 2013.
Many Chinese companies have invested in various sectors in Gabon, creating jobs and boosting local economic and social development, Zhu added.
The Gabonese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy in Gabon jointly organized the seminar themed "Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership between China and Gabon: Opportunities and Prospects." â–

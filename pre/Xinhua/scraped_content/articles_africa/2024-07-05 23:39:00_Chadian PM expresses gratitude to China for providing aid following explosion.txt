YAOUNDE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chadian Prime Minister Allamaye Halina extended his country's sincere gratitude on Friday to Chinese diplomats in the country for being the first to provide timely humanitarian aid to victims of an explosion in Chad's capital N'Djamena.
Halina said that Chinese diplomats had responded with "unprecedented generosity through a donation of 15 tonnes of flour."
"This gesture which warms our hearts and which brings relief to the affected families is welcome. In these difficult times, we are witnesses to this international solidarity, which transcends borders and cultural differences. Their compassion and quick action are an example for us all," Halina said in a statement on his social media platforms.
The Chinese donation was made after the country's authorities requested aid from friendly countries and partners following the explosion that killed nine people and injured 46 others at an ammunition warehouse in N'Djamena on June 18.
"I would like to personally thank Chinese diplomats for their attentive listening ear and commitment to our nation. Their support strengthens our determination to overcome this unexpected ordeal... We are deeply grateful to our Chinese friends for their gesture of solidarity," he said. â–

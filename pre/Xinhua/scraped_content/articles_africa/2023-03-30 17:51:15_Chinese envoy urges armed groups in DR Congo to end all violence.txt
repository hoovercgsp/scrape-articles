UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to end all their violent activities and withdraw from occupied areas.
Continued attacks by armed groups in the eastern DRC may worsen the security situation in the country despite active efforts made by the DRC government to advance security sector reform, combating armed groups, promoting economic development and preparing for general elections, said Dai Bing, charge d'affaires of China's permanent mission to the United Nations (UN) at a UN Security Council briefing.
"Ceasefire and cessation of violence are top priorities," he said.
Dai said that with the help of the African Union and regional countries such as Angola, the March 23 Movement armed group agreed to a ceasefire and dialogue in early March.
The envoy called on the international community to vigorously support humanitarian responses, pointing to "enormous humanitarian needs" in eastern DRC due to the worsening situation.
Relevant UN agencies and the DRC government should work together to maximize the benefit of their humanitarian assessments and ensure the safe and smooth delivery of supplies, he said.
While meeting short-term humanitarian needs, the international community should also help the DRC strengthen its capacity for independent development in accordance with its actual needs, said Dai.
He said China implements cooperation with the DRC on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results, adding that the cooperation projects have achieved remarkable results in supporting local industrial development, expanding employment and improving people's livelihood, and have been welcomed by the DRC government and its people.
"China would like to work with the international community to make more contributions to the peace and development of the DRC," said Dai. â–

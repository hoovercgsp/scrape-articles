ABUJA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The recently elevated relations between China and Nigeria are expected to yield strong results, scholars said at a symposium at the University of Abuja on Thursday, emphasizing the potential for deeper cooperation.
In September, China and Nigeria elevated bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership during a state visit by Nigerian President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
At the symposium, scholars expressed optimism that the new level of cooperation between the two countries would bolster development for their peoples.
"When we say comprehensive strategic partnership, it involves a lot of things, such as building mutual trust. Apart from that, there are also issues of mutual partnership and cooperation for development," Sheriff Ghali Ibrahim, founder of the Center For Contemporary China-Africa Research In Nigeria and co-host of the symposium, told Xinhua.
"With this, China is going to join hands with Nigeria in developing Nigeria's divergent sectors, such as science and technology transfer, culture, connectivity through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and a whole lot of things, including agriculture and industrialization," said Ibrahim, who is also a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Abuja.
The event, organized by the center and the Chinese Embassy in Abuja, gathered academics, policymakers, and representatives of civil society organizations. â–

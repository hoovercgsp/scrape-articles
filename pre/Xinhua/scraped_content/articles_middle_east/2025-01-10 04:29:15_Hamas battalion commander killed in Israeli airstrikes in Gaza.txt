JERUSALEM, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security sources said on Thursday that the commander of Hamas' battalion in Gaza City, his deputy and two elite Nukhba company commanders were killed in a series of airstrikes last week.
The airstrikes targeted Osama Abu Namos, the commander of the Sabra Battalion in the Gaza City Brigade of Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet security agency said in a joint statement.
The IDF and Shin Bet described Abu Namos as a Hamas militant who directed the group's activities against Israeli civilians and orchestrated attacks on IDF troops in an area known to Israel as the "Netzarim Corridor." The corridor, located in the central Gaza Strip, separates northern and southern Gaza and is an area where the Israeli military established bases and deployed troops.
"He served as a significant source of knowledge" for Hamas, the statement read.
In a separate airstrike, Mahmoud Al Tarq, Abu Namos' deputy, was killed. He also served as a Nukhba Forces company commander within the battalion, according to the statement.
Two other Hamas operatives, Mahmoud Shaheen and Hamada Diri, were killed in another strike, the IDF and Shin Bet stated.
Both were Nukhba Forces company commanders in the Sabra Battalion, the statement said, noting they were responsible for supplying weapons to militants in the battalion, and carried out attacks on Israeli troops in the corridor area. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military reported on Thursday that Houthi forces in Yemen have launched about 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 drones toward Israel since October 2023.
The Houthis, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, have carried out sporadic missile and drone attacks on Israel. In response, Israel has conducted several large-scale and deadly airstrikes in Yemen.
According to a statement released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), its Aerial Defense Array intercepted most of the missiles.
"So far, one fallen projectile has been identified, along with two partial interceptions that led to fragments falling in the area," the IDF stated. The remaining missile launches reportedly failed en route.
The IDF said that the Air Force intercepted over 100 of the drones.
"To date, two effective hits have been identified," it said, adding that other drones fell in open areas, failing to reach Israeli territory or causing no significant damage.
The attacks have caused casualties and damage in Israel. In July 2024, an explosive drone fired by the Houthi forces killed a man at his home in Tel Aviv. In December 2024, a missile intercepted by Israel struck an elementary school in Ramat Ef'al, a Tel Aviv suburb, causing extensive damage and leading to partial school closures. Later that month, a missile hit a residential area in Jaffa, southern Tel Aviv, lightly injuring 16 people and damaging buildings. â–

JERUSALEM, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has received from Hamas, through mediating countries, the names of three Israeli hostages to be released from Gaza on Saturday as part of a ceasefire-hostage deal, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
The three hostages, kidnapped in a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, are Ohad Ben Ami, 56, a dual Israeli-German citizen; Eli Sharabi, 52; and Or Levy, 34.
According to Israeli media reports, Ben Ami's wife was also kidnapped on Oct. 7, but was released after 54 days in captivity as part of a previous hostage deal.
This will be the fifth prisoner and hostage swap between Palestinian militants and Israel under the first stage of the ceasefire agreement, with Israel expected to release 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday. â–

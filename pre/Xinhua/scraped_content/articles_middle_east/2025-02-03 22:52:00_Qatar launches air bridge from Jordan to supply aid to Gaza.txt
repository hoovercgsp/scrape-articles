DOHA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Qatar launched on Monday an air bridge from King Abdullah II Air Base in Jordan to the Al-Qarara area in southern Gaza's Khan Younis to provide humanitarian and medical aid for the residents of Gaza, according to a statement released by Qatar's Foreign Ministry.
"Since the start of the (Gaza) truce, Qatar has delivered 65 relief trucks across the Jordanian border. Today, as an extension of this land bridge, we are witnessing the launch of two helicopter flights loaded with vital medical supplies to Khan Younis," the statement quoted Qatar's Minister of State for International Cooperation Maryam bint Ali bin Nasser Al Misnad as saying.
Qatar Charity and the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization also signed an agreement to facilitate the flow of Qatari humanitarian aid via land routes through Jordan, the statement added.
"Qatar has provided 20,000 tents, transported via a land bridge from Qatar to Jordan. We are working in cooperation with the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization to deliver them to our brothers and sisters in Gaza," the Qatari minister noted. â–

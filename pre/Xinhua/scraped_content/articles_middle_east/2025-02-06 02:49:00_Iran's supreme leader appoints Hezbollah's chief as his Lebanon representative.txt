TEHRAN, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has appointed Hezbollah's Secretary-General Naim Qassem as his representative in Lebanon, Iran's IRIB news agency reported on Wednesday.
The appointment was made in a decree issued by Khamenei, the report said.
The position was previously held by former Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut in September last year.
In October 2024, Hezbollah announced that Naim Qassem had been elected as its new secretary-general. â–

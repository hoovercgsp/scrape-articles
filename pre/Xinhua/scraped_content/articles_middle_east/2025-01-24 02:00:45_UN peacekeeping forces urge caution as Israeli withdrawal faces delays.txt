BEIRUT, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has advised Lebanese authorities to delay the return of residents to border villages, citing the continued presence of Israeli military forces in the area.
The advisory comes amidst increasing calls on social media for displaced residents to return on Sunday, the day Israel is scheduled to complete its withdrawal in southern Lebanon under a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel.
Citing UN sources, Lebanon's Al-Akhbar newspaper reported that Israeli forces informed a ceasefire monitoring committee they required additional time to withdraw from the eastern border sector. A complete withdrawal from the central and western sectors is expected within three days, the report added.
A Lebanese security source, speaking to Xinhua, stated that authorities have urged local officials and mayors to postpone return plans due to the danger posed by unexploded ordnance.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported further incidents involving Israeli forces, including the burning of a warehouse in Burj Al-Muluk village, the demolition of three homes in Deir Mimas, and the destruction of structures in agricultural areas near Maysat al-Wazzani and Qantara's eastern district.
Despite the warnings, some residents of Naqoura ventured back to inspect their homes, following the Israeli army's withdrawal from the town. The Lebanese army facilitated their return after issuing permits. Returning residents found widespread destruction to homes, infrastructure, power grids, and roads.
These developments occur as the ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024, approaches its deadline. The truce mandates a complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory within 60 days, after which the Lebanese army is expected to assume control of the border region and ensure its demilitarization south of the Litani River. â–

BAGHDAD, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said on Tuesday his government considers the World Bank a key partner in the reform process.
Al-Sudani made the remarks when meeting with Ousmane Dione, the World Bank's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa region, during which they discussed ways to enhance cooperation between the two sides, as well as the progress of development projects in Iraq, according to a statement by al-Sudani's media office.
Noting that development projects aimed at maximizing the non-oil economy and creating job opportunities are a top priority for the government, al-Sudani reaffirmed the government's commitment to advancing economic reforms that support the private sector and invited the World Bank to further strengthen this experience.
For his part, Dione pledged the World Bank's support in funding a number of Iraqi oil, energy, and infrastructure projects, adding that the contribution of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in financing private sector projects was explored.
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. â–

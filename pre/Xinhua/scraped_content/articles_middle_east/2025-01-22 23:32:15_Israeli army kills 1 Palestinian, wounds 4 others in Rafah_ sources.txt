GAZA, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army on Wednesday killed a Palestinian man and wounded four others while they were returning to their houses in Rafah city in southern Gaza, according to Palestinian sources.
Medical sources in the Naser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis told Xinhua that "a Palestinian man, still unidentified, was transferred to the hospital. In addition, the medical teams transferred the wounds to the hospital too."
Local eyewitnesses said that the army opened fire on some people who were trying to reach their houses in the Shaboura neighborhood in the city of Rafah despite the ceasefire in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health authorities said in a press statement that at least 54 bodies, including one who succumbed to his previous wound and 53 who were recovered from the rubble, were transferred to the hospitals in Gaza.
It added that the number of Palestinians who were killed by the Israeli army since Oct. 7, 2023, has risen to 47,161 and the wounds to 111,116. â–

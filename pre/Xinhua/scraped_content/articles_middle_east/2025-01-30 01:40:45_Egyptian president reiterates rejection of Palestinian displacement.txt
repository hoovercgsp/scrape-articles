CAIRO, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said on Wednesday that the displacement of Palestinians is an act of "injustice," in which Egypt will not participate.
"I say this with absolute clarity: the displacement and relocation of the Palestinian people is an injustice that we cannot take part in," Sisi said during a joint press conference with visiting Kenyan President William Ruto in Cairo, as aired on Egypt's state-run Nile TV.
"The displacement of Palestinians must not be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian and Arab national security," the Egyptian president added.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently proposed relocating Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to neighboring Jordan and Egypt, a plan that has faced regional and international rejection.
Sisi emphasized that Egypt's historic stance on the Palestinian cause can never be compromised, stating that Egypt is determined to work with the United States to achieve the desired peace, based on the two-state solution.
He explained that the recent Hamas-Israel conflict, which lasted over 15 months, is a consequence of years of failure to resolve the Palestinian issue. "Thus, the root causes of the problem have not been addressed," he added. â–

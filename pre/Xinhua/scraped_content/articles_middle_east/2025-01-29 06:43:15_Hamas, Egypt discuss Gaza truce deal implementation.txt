GAZA/CAIRO, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Hamas said on Tuesday that a delegation led by the head of its leadership council, Mohamed Darwish, has met with Egypt's intelligence chief, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, in Cairo for discussion on the implementation of the ongoing Gaza ceasefire agreement.
In a statement, Hamas said the meeting addressed the developments in the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement, which was brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.
Hamas thanked Egypt for its critical role in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza and its firm opposition to the displacement of Palestinians from their land.
During the meeting, the two sides also emphasized the need to obligate Israel to comply fully with all terms of the truce deal without delay or obstruction.
In addition, the Hamas delegation discussed with Rashad efforts to restructure Palestinian politics, including proposals to form a national unity government or create a community support committee to strengthen Palestinian unity amid ongoing challenges.
Meanwhile, well-informed Egyptian sources told Xinhua that it was agreed during the two sides' talks to release Israeli female hostage Arbel Yehud, alongside another hostage, within the next 48 hours.
According to the sources, the Hamas delegation conveyed it would transfer three Israeli prisoners and the remains of eight Israeli soldiers to the Israeli side on Saturday. â–

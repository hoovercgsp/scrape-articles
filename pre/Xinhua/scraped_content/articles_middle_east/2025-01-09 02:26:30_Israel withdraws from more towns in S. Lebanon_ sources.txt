BEIRUT, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces have withdrawn from several border towns in southern Lebanon, a Lebanese security source told Xinhua on Wednesday.
The source said the Lebanese army would expand its deployment to these villages, with a date to be set later in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
The Lebanese army has also informed the committee overseeing the ceasefire in southern Lebanon that it confiscated and will destroy a weapons cache found at several border points, the source added.
Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that Israeli forces had conducted house demolitions in the villages of Kfar Kila, Aita al-Shaab, Houla, Taybeh and Taloussa, located in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon.
A U.S.- and French-brokered ceasefire, which came into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, aimed to end nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
The ceasefire agreement stipulates Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territory within 60 days, with the Lebanese army deploying along the Lebanese-Israeli border and in the south to assume security and prevent the presence of weapons and militants.
Despite the agreement, Israeli forces have continued sporadic strikes in Lebanon, resulting in casualties, according to reports. â–

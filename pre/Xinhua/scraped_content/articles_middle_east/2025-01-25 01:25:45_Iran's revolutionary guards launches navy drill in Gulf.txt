TEHRAN, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) navy launched a large-scale naval drill in southern waters on Friday, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
The exercise is taking place off the coasts of Bushehr and Khuzestan provinces, the report said.
IRGC Navy Commander Alireza Tangsiri said the drill aimed to show "peace and friendship" to neighbors and that Iran and regional states could ensure security and confront any threat.
He also said the exercise sent a message to outside powers that their presence disrupted regional security, adding that new missile-firing vessels capable of speeds up to 90 knots and new naval mines would be unveiled. â–

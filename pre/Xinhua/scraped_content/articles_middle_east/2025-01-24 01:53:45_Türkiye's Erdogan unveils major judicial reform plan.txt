ANKARA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday introduced a comprehensive judicial reform plan, stating that it aims to enhance the independence, transparency, and efficiency of Türkiye's judicial system.
Speaking at the reform's introductory meeting, Erdogan said the change would enhance legal security, ensure timely proceedings, establish a predictable justice system, streamline procedures, and foster trust and satisfaction with the judiciary.
The reform focuses on expanding restorative and compensatory justice practices, particularly pre-litigation alternative dispute resolution methods. It also aims to strengthen the effectiveness and deterrence of the criminal justice system and accelerate the digital transformation of justice services and forensic sciences.
Additionally, the plan includes measures to increase the number of courts and convert some single-judge courts into judicial panels, thereby improving decision-making processes.
Erdogan also highlighted the government's efforts to draft a new constitution, which he described as "reconciliatory, unifying, libertarian, and inclusive of all segments of society."
The president also promised to ensure more effective protection of rights and freedoms through a new Human Rights Action Plan. ■

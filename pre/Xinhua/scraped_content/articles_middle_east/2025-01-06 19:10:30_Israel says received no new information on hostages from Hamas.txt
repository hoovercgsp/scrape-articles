JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel said on Monday that it has received no new information from Hamas regarding a list of 34 hostages reportedly approved for exchange in a potential Gaza ceasefire deal.
The list, widely circulated in both Israeli and Arab media, includes 12 women and children, 11 men aged 50 or above, and 11 young men with medical conditions.
In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the condition of the hostages reportedly included in the list remains unknown. Hamas has not clarified whether these individuals are alive or deceased. "As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages on the list," the office stated.
It further noted that the list was originally compiled by Israel and transferred to mediators in July 2024.
Mediation talks are being held in Doha, Qatar, with an aim to reach a ceasefire in the 15-month war between Israel and Hamas and to secure the release of approximately 100 hostages still held by Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip.
The primary points of contention between the two warring parties focus on the duration of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas demands a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel insists on a temporary truce and a military presence in the Palestinian enclave.
Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage.
The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in Gaza has risen to 45,854, with injuries reaching 109,139, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Monday. â–

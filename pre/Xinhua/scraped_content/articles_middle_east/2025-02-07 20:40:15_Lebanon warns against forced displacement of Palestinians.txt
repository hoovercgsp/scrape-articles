BEIRUT, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants warned on Friday that the forced displacement of Palestinians is an attempt to liquidate the Palestinian cause and undermine the Palestinians' right of return, particularly for refugees in Lebanon.
In a statement released on social media platform X, the ministry expressed "deep concern over plans to uproot the Palestinian people from their land, which is their historical and legal right under relevant international resolutions."
The ministry stressed that "any attempt to seize Palestinian lands and forcibly displace their people constitutes an effort to eradicate the Palestinian cause and strip refugees --especially those in Lebanon -- of their right of return." It described such actions as a flagrant violation of international law, human rights charters, and the Lebanese constitution.
Lebanon reaffirmed its commitment to international legitimacy and "the fundamental human right to live with dignity within one's homeland."
The statement called on the international community to "take urgent and serious steps to implement the two-state solution as the only viable path to securing Palestinian rights, alleviating their decades-long humanitarian suffering, and ending the cycle of violence and instability in the region."
The remarks come in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent statements regarding Gaza. On Thursday, Trump repeated his proposal that the United States could take control of the Gaza Strip after relocating Palestinians elsewhere.
"The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting," Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. He added that Palestinians "would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region." â–

DUBAI, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has projected that the economies of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries will grow by 3.4 percent and 4.1 percent in 2025 and 2026 respectively, the UAE's official news agency WAM reported Wednesday.
Ousmane Dione, vice president for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region of the World Bank, told WAM on the sidelines of the 2025 World Governments Summit that while the overall economic outlook remains positive, growth trajectories will differ between oil-producing and oil-importing countries.
"The GCC countries maintain a strong economic position thanks to their diversification efforts. In contrast, other countries in the region continue to face challenges related to conflicts and instability," Dione said.
"Gulf economies benefit from substantial investments in non-oil sectors, providing them a competitive advantage over countries struggling with geopolitical instability," Dione added. â–

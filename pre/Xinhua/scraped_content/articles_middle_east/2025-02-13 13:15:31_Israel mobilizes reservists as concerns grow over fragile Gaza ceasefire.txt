JERUSALEM, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel has mobilized military reservists in preparation for a potential resumption of military offensive in Gaza in case Hamas fails to release additional hostages by a Saturday deadline.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the country would resume "intense fighting" if Hamas fails to meet the deadline, without specifying the number of hostages to be released.
The Israeli military also confirmed that it was deploying additional troops to the southern region near Gaza, including the mobilization of reservists.
Under the ceasefire deal with Hamas that took effect on Jan. 19, Hamas is to set free three more hostages on Saturday. Earlier this week, the group said that it was suspending the handover, citing what it claimed were Israeli violations of the ceasefire.
Hamas' decision prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to suggest that Israel cancel the agreement entirely, saying all hostages must be freed by noon on Saturday or he would "let hell break out."
Concerns over the ceasefire's collapse grow as there is increasing outrage in the Arab world over Trump's proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip.
On Wednesday, Jordanian King Abdullah II discussed "dangerous developments" in Gaza and the West Bank in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The phone call came one day after the Jordanian king met with Trump in Washington, where he reiterated his country's "steadfast position" against Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza. â–

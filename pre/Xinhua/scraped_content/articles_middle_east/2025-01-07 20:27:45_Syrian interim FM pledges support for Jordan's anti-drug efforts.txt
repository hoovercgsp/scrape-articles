AMMAN, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani visited Jordan on Tuesday to discuss security and economic cooperation, marking a shift in bilateral relations following Damascus's recent change in leadership.
Al-Shibani and his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi agreed to establish a joint committee focusing on security, energy, and other areas of mutual interest, Jordan's state-owned broadcaster Al Mamlaka TV reported.
During the talks in Amman, al-Shibani pledged that Syria would support Jordan's efforts to combat drug trafficking, particularly the flow of captagon pills across their shared border.
"The stability of Syria means stability for Jordan, and Syria's security positively impacts Jordan," Safadi told reporters, adding that Jordan was prepared to begin immediate electricity supplies to Syria.
Al-Shibani, representing Syria's interim administration, emphasized his government's commitment to working with regional and international partners to ensure Syria's stability and territorial integrity.
The Syrian minister expressed gratitude for Jordan's hosting of Syrian refugees and called for enhanced bilateral cooperation in reconstruction, investment, and water security.
"This marks the beginning of a new chapter in Jordanian-Syrian relations," al-Shibani said.
The high-level meeting follows Syria's recent government transition and signals potential warming ties between the neighboring countries. â–

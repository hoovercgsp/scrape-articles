JERUSALEM, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Defense Ministry announced on Monday that it will develop an airborne self-protection suite for the country's F-16I fighter fleet.
In a statement, the ministry said the aircraft will be equipped with innovative technologies to ensure maximum protection in complex combat scenarios.
The defense suite, jointly developed by the ministry, Israeli Air Force (IAF), and defense electronics company Elbit with an investment of about 80 million U.S. dollars, will feature an advanced electronic warfare system and an optronic missile warning and detection system to identify airborne and ground threats early.
Additionally, it will include a cutting-edge chaff and flare dispersion system, offering extra protection by deceiving homing missiles.
The F-16I, nicknamed "Sufa" ("storm" in Hebrew), is a variant of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon specifically designed for IAF.
It is a two-seat, multi-role fighter jet, equipped with advanced avionics, weapons systems, and modifications tailored to Israel's defense needs. It can carry out air-to-air, air-to-ground, and long-range strikes. â–

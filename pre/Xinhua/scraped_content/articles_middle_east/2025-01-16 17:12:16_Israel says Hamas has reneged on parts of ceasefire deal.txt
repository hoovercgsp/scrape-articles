JERUSALEM, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel Prime Minister's Office said Thursday morning Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel "in an effort to extort last-minute concessions."
The Israeli Cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement, said the office in a statement. â–

DOHA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Majed Al Ansari confirmed on Tuesday that the next round of hostage exchanges is set to proceed as scheduled this weekend, highlighting ongoing efforts to finalize the details through close coordination and the exchange of name lists between the involved parties.
During the ministry's weekly media briefing, Al Ansari expressed optimism about the process, stating, "We believe the upcoming exchange will proceed more smoothly."
Regarding the second phase of the agreement, he noted, "We are withholding technical details regarding the implementation until it occurs to ensure its success. However, I can confirm that all details are currently being discussed in the operations room between the parties involved."
He reaffirmed that the ceasefire agreement remains in place as long as negotiations continue, stressing that the primary responsibilities lie with the parties involved.
"That being said, we have observed positive implementation on the ground, including the delivery of over 900 aid trucks and the successful prisoner exchange. This gives us confidence that the implementation of the agreement is being carried out positively," he added.
On Qatar's stance regarding normalization with Israel, Al Ansari reiterated, "Normalization with Israel must align with a permanent solution to the Palestinian issue, which can only be achieved through a two-state solution." â–

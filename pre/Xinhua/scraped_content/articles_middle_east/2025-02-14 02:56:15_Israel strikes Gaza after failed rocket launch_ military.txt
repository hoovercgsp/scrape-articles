JERUSALEM, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military said it struck Gaza on Thursday in retaliation for an earlier alleged attempt to fire a rocket from the enclave.
The attack targeted "the launcher from which the rocket launch in the Gaza Strip was identified," a military spokesperson said in a statement.
The rocket did not cross into Israel but killed a 14-year-old boy in Gaza, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper.
No group immediately assumed responsibility for the rocket launch.
It was the first reported attempt by Gaza militants to fire a rocket toward Israel since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect on Jan. 19.
The incident occurred amid a crisis that threatened to collapse the fragile truce. Hamas said Thursday it would release three more hostages on Saturday as agreed and reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement following talks with mediators. However, Israel denied that any understanding had been reached and did not withdraw its threat to resume attacks on Gaza. â–

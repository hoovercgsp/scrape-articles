JERUSALEM, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces expanded their military operation in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, launching a raid in the Nur Shams refugee camp, a military spokesperson said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that large forces from the IDF, Shin Bet security agency and Border Police began operating overnight in Nur Shams. The camp, located in the Tulkarm Governorate in the northwestern West Bank, has been a focal point of recent raids.
The military said its forces shot several militants and arrested additional individuals.
The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that a pregnant woman was killed by Israeli gunfire. The Red Crescent said two other people were shot and badly wounded.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the operation aimed to "crush terror infrastructures" in the West Bank.
The Israeli military launched the major campaign in Jenin on Jan. 21 and expanded it last week to the town of Tamun, southeast of Jenin. â–

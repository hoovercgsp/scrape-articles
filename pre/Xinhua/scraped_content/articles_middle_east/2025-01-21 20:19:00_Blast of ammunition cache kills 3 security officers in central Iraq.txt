BAGHDAD, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Three security officers were killed and four others wounded on Tuesday in an ammunition cache explosion north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the Iraqi military said.
Acting on intelligence, troops were inspecting a hidden cache of old ammunition in the Tarmiyah area, some 40 km north of Baghdad, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
A technical error during the inspection triggered the blast, the statement said.
Iraqi security authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, it said, clarifying that the explosion was not the result of a terrorist act or an armed clash with terrorist groups, refuting incorrect reports suggesting otherwise. â–

ISTANBUL, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye's first indigenous multirole utility helicopter has successfully passed cold climate tests in Sweden, marking a significant milestone, state-owned defense company Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) announced on Thursday.
In a statement on social media platform X, TAI highlighted that its T625 Gokbey Helicopter showcased Türkiye's advancements in aviation to the world.
The cold climate tests took place in Kiruna, a city in northern Sweden, at a temperature of minus 25 degrees Celsius.
The state-run Anadolu Agency reported that the helicopter covered over 600 test points and 60 flight hours. TAI's ground personnel, pilots, flight test engineers, and design and project staff closely monitored the tests on-site.
According to TAI's website, the Gokbey Helicopter is designed to perform reliably in the toughest climates and terrains, operating effectively at high altitudes and in extreme temperatures.
It can perform various missions, including transport, cargo delivery, air ambulance, search and rescue, and offshore transport.
The Gokbey completed its maiden flight in 2018. In 2023, the helicopter's prototype performed its inaugural test flight, powered by the domestically developed and produced TEI-TS1400 Turboshaft Engines. ■

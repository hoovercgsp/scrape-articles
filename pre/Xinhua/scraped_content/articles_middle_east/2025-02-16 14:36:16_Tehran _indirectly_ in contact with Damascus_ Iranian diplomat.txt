TEHRAN, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian diplomat has confirmed that Tehran is "indirectly" in contact with Damascus, the official news agency IRNA reported on Saturday.
Mohammad-Reza Raouf Sheibani, the Iranian foreign minister's special envoy for Syria, announced the news during a press briefing in Moscow Friday night. His statement addressed recent comments by Syria's interim Foreign Minister, Asaad Hassan al-Shibani, regarding the exchange of messages between Damascus and Tehran, the report said.
Iran had adopted a "forward-looking" approach to Syria's developments and the restoration of bilateral relations, closely and patiently monitoring the situation to make decisions at the "appropriate" time, he said.
Highlighting Syria's unique role in the Middle East, Sheibani said, "We believe that the country's future and fate should be decided by its people and with all political groups' participation."
He emphasized that Iran attaches "special" importance to Syria's stability and peace while opposing any foreign interference in the Arab state's internal affairs.
The Iranian diplomat said that during his visit to Moscow, he discussed Syria's latest developments with the Russian president's special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, adding that Iran and Russia shared similar views on issues regarding Syria.
Syria's interim foreign minister said Wednesday that his country had received "positive messages," but wanted further reassurance from Russia and Iran.
"There are positive messages, but we want these positive messages to turn into a clear policy that makes the Syrian people feel reassured," he said. â–

RIYADH, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- "Chinese Kung Fu is amazing!" "The face-changing in Sichuan Opera is incredible!" "Candied hawthorn is delicious!" These exclamations echoed through the Cultural Palace in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh during a vibrant "Spring Festival Market" held from Friday to Saturday.
Themed "Warmly Welcoming Spring, Celebrating Chinese New Year Together," the market was organized by the Chinese Embassy in Saudi Arabia and designed as a traditional Chinese New Year temple fair. It also marked the start of events to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the establishment of China-Saudi Arabia diplomatic relations and the China-Saudi Arabia Year of Culture in 2025.
Chinese expatriates, foreign diplomats, Saudi officials, and locals gathered at the event, enjoying an atmosphere brimming with joy and cultural spirit.
The market featured Chinese cultural performances, intangible cultural heritage exhibits, traditional games, e-sports interactions, contemporary films, and a bustling Chinese food street.
In addition to traditional performances like Shaolin Kung Fu, Sichuan Opera face-changing, ethnic dances, and folk music, interactive activities such as calligraphy, paper-cutting, and Hanfu (traditional Chinese clothing) experiences offered attendees a hands-on opportunity to immerse themselves in Chinese culture.
Over two days, ambassadors from Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Venezuela, the Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Austria, Ireland, India, and Azerbaijan joined the festivities.
During the event, Chinese Ambassador Chang Hua said the Spring Festival has become a widely recognized symbol of Chinese culture, and its global influence continues to grow. "We hope this festival serves as a bridge for cultural exchange and mutual understanding."
Thai Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Darm Boontham congratulated China on its success in including the Chinese Spring Festival in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list and highly praised the event. "Culture is a silent language, and such events allow people to understand each other better," he said.
A standout attraction was the Chinese e-sports area, featuring popular games like "Black Myth: Wukong" and "Honor of Kings." Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, president of the Saudi National E-Sports Association, expressed enthusiasm for future collaboration, stating that e-sports are a way to connect young people worldwide.
"As we saw with 'Black Myth: Wukong,' it also represents the export of Chinese culture. We can create games about Saudi culture and bring them to China and the world," remarked the prince.
The Chinese food street was a crowd favorite, offering authentic delicacies such as Beijing roast duck, roujiamo (Chinese hamburger), and candied hawthorn. Visitors eagerly queued to savor the flavors of China and purchase traditional New Year goods.
Ahmad Sulaiman, whose Chinese name is Zhang Yunfei and the champion of Saudi Arabia's first "Chinese Bridge" competition, shared, "I flew from Jeddah to Riyadh to invite my friends to the market. The event reminded me of being in Beijing. The paper-cutting, eggshell painting, and sugar art amazed me and deepened my love for Chinese culture."
Chinese pop singer Liu Genghong added energy to the festival, leading attendees in a fitness dance that resonated with both Chinese and Saudi participants. "Experiencing such a strong New Year atmosphere in Saudi Arabia is surprising and heartwarming," Liu told Xinhua. He wished Chinese expatriates a happy and healthy New Year, emphasizing the importance of reunion and well-being.
The two-day Spring Festival Market attracted over 5,000 attendees. â–

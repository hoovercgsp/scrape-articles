JERUSALEM, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, was discovered in a turkey farm in central Israel, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security said in a statement on Monday.
The virus outbreak was detected at a six-structure coop in the Zorah village, about 20 kilometers west of Jerusalem, after 9,800 turkeys, aged 17.5 weeks, died there.
To prevent the spread of the disease, all chicken coops within a 10-km radius of the infected area were quarantined and monitored.
The ministry urged bird breeders to keep their animals indoors and recommended that the public buy well-packaged eggs from regulated sources and cook poultry and eggs thoroughly.
Bird flu is highly contagious, affecting various animals, with rare cases of human infection. â–

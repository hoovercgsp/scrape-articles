KABUL, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- An iron-smelting plant worth 200 million U.S. dollars will be opened in Maidan Shar city, the capital of eastern Afghanistan's Wardak province, the state-owned Bakhtar news agency reported Friday.
The factory will be capable of daily production of 12.5 tons and will create thousands of job opportunities, the report said without more details.
As part of efforts to alleviate poverty and achieve self-sufficiency, the Afghan caretaker government has been reactivating damaged factories across the country and encouraging domestic and foreign companies to invest in the country. â–

RAMALLAH, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had a phone conversation with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on Friday to discuss the situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
The Palestinian News Agency WAFA reported that Abbas congratulated Aoun on his victory in the Lebanese presidential elections.
During the call, Abbas reaffirmed Palestine's support for Aoun's speech at the Lebanese parliament after election, particularly regarding Palestinian issues and the situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
Abbas emphasized the need to "provide a dignified life for refugees under Lebanese law until they can return to their homeland, following the establishment of our independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. He also said he looked forward to building "relations of brotherhood and fruitful cooperation" with Lebanon.
According to a report issued by UNRWA, the number of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon reached 493,201 by 2023.
Palestinian factions and organizations are responsible for maintaining security in the refugee camps, while the Lebanese army and security forces enforce strict measures around them.
Abbas also expressed hope that Aoun's election as Lebanese president would bring hope to the Lebanese people in facing current challenges and lead the country toward progress and prosperity.
Aoun took the oath of office on Thursday before the Lebanese parliament. In his inauguration speech, Aoun rejected the settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, underscoring their right of return. He also pledged to ensure the security of refugee camps, according to Lebanon's National News Agency. â–

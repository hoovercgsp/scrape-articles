GAZA, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military has ramped up airstrikes on the Gaza Strip amid revived negotiations in Doha aimed at halting a 15-month conflict, Palestinian officials and witnesses reported.
The surge in attacks followed a warning earlier on Sunday from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, who vowed "stronger strikes than Gaza has seen in a long time" unless Hamas ceases rocket fire and releases hostages.
Local residents described the raids as among the most intense since the war began.
Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense, told Xinhua that at least 17 Palestinians were killed in the strikes on Sunday. He detailed that five people died in an airstrike targeting a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, while four others were killed in Jabalia. In Khan Yunis, five were killed, and dozens injured in a strike on a Hamas police center. Three more fatalities occurred in two separate airstrikes in Rafah.
The Hamas-led media office reported that the Israeli military has conducted 94 airstrikes over the past 72 hours, leaving 184 dead. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it targeted 100 locations in Gaza over the weekend, claiming to have killed dozens of Hamas operatives.
Efforts to broker a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal have gained momentum in Doha, with mediators from Egypt and Qatar applying pressure on both sides. Palestinian sources familiar with the discussions said Hamas has shown flexibility toward a phased agreement.
Israeli media outlet Yedioth Ahronoth cited officials suggesting that the talks focus on a "limited, partial deal," including a short-term ceasefire of six to eight weeks and a prisoner exchange. Mossad chief David Barnea is set to join the Israeli delegation in Doha on Monday.
Amid the violence, civilians in Gaza expressed mixed feelings about the prospects of a truce. Samir al-Amoudi, a displaced resident of Khan Yunis, voiced hope for a swift resolution. "Every day, dozens die, and entire families are erased. We must stop this catastrophe," the father of six said.
Others, however, remain skeptical. "There's no optimism yet," said Ahmed al-Hams, also from Khan Yunis. "The suffering grows daily -- killing, destruction, starvation. This must end."
The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. Israel responded with large-scale air and ground operations in Gaza, where over two million residents face mounting casualties and devastation. According to the health authorities in Gaza's Sunday tally, Israeli strikes have killed approximately 45,805 Palestinians and injured over 109,064. â–

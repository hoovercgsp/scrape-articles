TEHRAN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday unveiled a new homegrown ballistic missile with an operational range of 1,700 km, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.
The missile, dubbed "Etemad" (Trust), was unveiled during President Masoud Pezeshkian's visit to an exhibition of the Defense Ministry's aerospace industries in the capital Tehran, the report said.
With a length of 16 meters and a diameter of 1.25 meters, the missile is equipped with a precision-guided warhead, according to Fars.
Speaking during the visit, Pezeshkian stressed that Iran's defense capabilities had reached such a high level that they could dissuade the "enemies" from even thinking of attacking the country, according to a statement published on the website of his office.
He added that Iran's expanded defense capabilities aimed at safeguarding national security by preventing any act of aggression, and the country did not seek to attack other states. â–

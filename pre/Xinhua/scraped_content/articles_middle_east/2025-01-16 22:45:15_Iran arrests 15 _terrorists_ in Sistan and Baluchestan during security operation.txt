TEHRAN, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Forces announced on Thursday the arrest of 15 individuals accused of planning sabotage in the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The IRGC's Quds Base said the arrests took place during the ongoing "Martyrs of Security" operation. Security forces identified the group in the border areas between Iran and Pakistan and captured them through a coordinated ground operation, supported by intelligence officers, military helicopters, and drones, the IRNA reported.
The operation also led to the seizure of a large cache of weapons and ammunition.
Sistan and Baluchestan, a province bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been the site of several terrorist attacks targeting both civilians and security forces in recent years. â–

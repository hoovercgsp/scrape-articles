MUSCAT, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi met here with Yemeni Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Shaya Mohsin Zindani on Wednesday to strengthen bilateral ties and discuss cooperation, Oman's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The meeting underscored the depth of fraternal relations between Oman and Yemen, highlighting their shared commitment to enhancing collaboration in fields of mutual interest, it said.
Discussions between the two officials centered on regional and international issues, particularly the ongoing "Yemeni crisis" and efforts to achieve peace and stability in Yemen, it noted.
Al Busaidi reiterated Oman's unwavering support for peaceful initiatives in Yemen, stressing the importance of dialogue and negotiations as pathways to sustainable solutions and an end to the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people.
For his part, Zindani expressed gratitude for Oman's steadfast support for Yemen's stability and its continued assistance to the Yemeni people.
He commended Oman's "positive role" in facilitating dialogue among Yemeni factions and supporting international efforts to secure peace in the region.
On Tuesday, Oman's Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Water Resources, Saud Hamoud Al Habsi, held discussions with Zindani to enhance cooperation in agriculture, fisheries, and water resource management.
Both sides explored investment and partnership opportunities in food security projects and addressed fisheries and livestock-related challenges.
Yemen has been embroiled in a devastating civil war since 2014, with the Houthis fighting against the internationally-recognized Yemeni government. The Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in the conflict in support of the Yemeni government in 2015. â–

ABU DHABI, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced on Wednesday that it has successfully mediated the exchange of 50 captives between Russia and Ukraine, marking a significant step in ongoing diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the two nations.
According to the UAE Foreign Ministry, the exchange involved 25 captives from each side and brought the total number of prisoners exchanged under the UAE's mediation to 2,583 since the start of its efforts.
This latest exchange is the 11th such operation facilitated by the UAE since early 2024.
In a statement, the ministry expressed gratitude to both Russia and Ukraine for their collaboration, highlighting their trust in the UAE's mediation capabilities.
"The success of this mediation reflects the UAE's steadfast commitment to peacefully resolving the conflict and addressing its humanitarian consequences," the ministry said.
The UAE-mediated exchange of captives followed a previous one in December last year, during which Russia and Ukraine freed 150 captives each. â–

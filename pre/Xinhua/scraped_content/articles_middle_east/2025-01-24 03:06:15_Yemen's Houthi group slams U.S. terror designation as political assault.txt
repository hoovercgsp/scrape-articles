ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Houthi group on Thursday rejected the United States' decision to reclassify them as a "Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)," calling the move a politically motivated attack on Yemen's sovereignty.
In a statement from the Houthi-backed "foreign ministry" in Sanaa, the Houthis condemned the U.S. classification as "a deliberate attempt to pressure Yemen and demonstrate bias towards Israel in the ongoing Gaza conflict."
The group accused the United States of using terrorist designations as political tools, arguing that the classification represents more than an administrative action. Instead, they characterized it as an assault on Yemeni solidarity with Palestinian resistance.
The Houthis emphasized their strategic position in supporting Palestinian rights and defending Yemen's territorial integrity, warning that such "provocative measures" would only strengthen their resolve.
They called on the international community to denounce what they termed an "unjust classification" that could worsen Yemen's humanitarian crisis.
In contrast, the internationally recognized Yemeni government supported Washington's decision, asserting that the classification accurately reflects the Houthis' potential threat to regional security.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to re-designate the Houthis as an FTO, effectively reversing a previous Biden administration decision that had removed the group from the list.
The reclassification follows escalating tensions in the Red Sea, where the Houthis have conducted maritime operations targeting vessels they claim are linked to Israel. In response, the United States and Britain have conducted retaliatory strikes against the group's infrastructure in Yemen. â–

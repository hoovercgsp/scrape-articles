ANKARA, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye has established a new Cybersecurity Directorate to strengthen defense against cyber threats, according to a presidential decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday.
The newly-formed body will be responsible for implementing decisions made by the Cybersecurity Board, which will be chaired by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The board will also include key ministries such as interior, justice, defense, transport and infrastructure, along with industry and technology.
In a post on the social media platform X, Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said that the directorate will determine policies, strategies, and objectives to ensure cybersecurity, prepare action plans, and implement projects supporting cybersecurity and information security.
The vice president said the directorate will also enhance cooperation between the public and private sector and universities.
The Turkish government introduced a cybersecurity roadmap in 2024 aimed at improving the protection of the country's information infrastructure and boosting national preparedness against cyber threats. ■

TEHRAN, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei on Friday strongly condemned a deadly "terrorist" bomb attack in southwestern Pakistan's Balochistan province, which reportedly resulted in at least 11 people killed and six others injured.
In a statement released by the ministry, Baghaei extended condolences to the victims' families, as well as the Pakistani people and government, and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
According to a Pakistani official, the deadly roadside bomb blast took place in the Harnai district of Balochistan earlier in the day, hitting a vehicle that was carrying laborers en route to a coal mine. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
Baghaei underscored Iran's "principled" position in condemning all forms of terrorism anywhere in the world, highlighting the necessity to strengthen efforts and cooperation at the bilateral and regional levels to combat terrorism. â–

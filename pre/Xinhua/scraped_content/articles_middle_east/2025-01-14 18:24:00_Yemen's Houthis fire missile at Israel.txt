JERUSALEM, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi forces fired a missile at Israel early on Tuesday, triggering sirens in wide areas, including Tel Aviv and some Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, according to an Israeli military statement.
"Several attempts were made to intercept the missile," the military said, adding, "It was likely intercepted."
No injuries were reported, but the attack caused property damage. The police said in a statement that homes in Mevo Beitar and Tzur Hadassah on the outskirts of Jerusalem were damaged. An image released by the police showed a missile fragment embedded in the roof of a residential home.
Bomb disposal units and additional police forces are operating in the area to assess the damage and secure the site.
The attack came a day after Houthi forces launched a drone and a ballistic missile toward Israel, both of which were intercepted.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have been carrying out missile and drone attacks on Israel and disrupting "Israeli-linked" shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians amid their ongoing conflict with Israelis in the Gaza Strip. â–

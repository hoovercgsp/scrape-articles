ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- An explosion at a gas station in Yemen's central province of Al-Bayda on Saturday killed at least 10 people and left more than 65 others injured, a local government official told Xinhua.
The official said on condition of anonymity that "the blast occurred at a gas filling station in Zaher district, setting off a chain reaction that engulfed two adjacent gas stations and nearby commercial warehouses in flames."
The station was busy with customers when the blast occurred, he said, adding that investigators have yet to determine its exact cause.
Graphic footage circulating on social media platforms showed a massive explosion followed by scenes of chaos as injured civilians fled the burning gas station complex. â–

JERUSALEM, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Thursday night, with Israel's military claiming the attacks were aimed at Hezbollah targets, despite a ceasefire between the two countries.
Lebanon's TV channel LBCI reported that the warplanes targeted localities near the Litani River, including the towns of Yohmor al-Shaqif and Zoutr al-Sharqiya, in addition to the municipalities of Deir Siryan, Zibqin and Yater.
There were no immediate reports of fatalities.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military released a statement, saying its strikes targeted "Hezbollah military sites containing weapons and launchers that pose a direct threat to the Israeli home front."
Israel has continued to conduct intermittent strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon despite the ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024. â–

BEIRUT, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud reiterated Saudi Arabia's support for Lebanon during a visit to Beirut on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of reforms for the country's stability and progress.
Faisal met with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun at Baabda Palace, according to a statement released by the Lebanese Presidency. He conveyed greetings from Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"The kingdom would stand by Lebanon throughout its journey of renewal, working closely with its partners to ensure stability and progress," the statement quoted Faisal as saying. He also highlighted the importance of planned reforms and said the Saudi crown prince supported initiatives to improve Lebanon's future.
For his part, Aoun expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia's support, particularly in helping resolve the recent presidential vacancy. He described the visit as a "message of hope" and highlighted the historical ties between the two countries, expressing his desire for stronger bilateral relations. He also outlined his administration's priorities, including reconstruction, economic recovery, and strengthening security institutions.
The Saudi foreign minister also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, reaffirming the kingdom's commitment to Lebanon and urging the prioritization of national interests and the implementation of reforms.
Salam welcomed Faisal's visit, noting it was the first such visit by a Saudi foreign minister to Lebanon in 15 years, reiterating his commitment to implementing political, judicial, administrative, and financial reforms and restoring Lebanon's position within the Arab world.
Aoun was elected Lebanon's new president on Jan. 9, filling the presidency left vacant for around two years due to deep political divisions. Days later, on Jan. 13, Aoun appointed Salam, former president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as Lebanon's new prime minister and tasked him with forming a government.
The developments are widely viewed as a sign of Hezbollah's waning influence in Lebanon, marking a potential shift in the country's political landscape. â–

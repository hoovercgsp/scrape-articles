BAGHDAD, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Islamic State (IS) militants were killed in an airstrike in the central Iraqi province of Salahuddin, the Iraqi military said on Tuesday.
Acting on intelligence, Iraqi forces conducted the airstrike on Monday, targeting an IS hideout in the Balkana area in the northeastern part of the province, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
A joint force of army and intelligence personnel searched the bombed area on Tuesday morning, where they found the bodies of two militants, along with weapons, mobile phones, and other logistical supplies, the statement added.
While Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, remnants of the group continue to carry out attacks against security forces and civilians in urban areas, deserts, and remote regions. â–

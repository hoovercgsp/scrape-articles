BEIRUT, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon Imran Riza announced Friday a 30-million-U.S. dollar allocation from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund (LHF) to support war-affected vulnerable populations in Lebanon.
"This new allocation provides a vital lifeline, supporting both those returning to damaged (civilian) infrastructure and those remaining displaced with timely and effective aid," Riza said.
According to a statement from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the allocation will enable partners to deliver targeted assistance in food security, shelter, nutrition, protection, healthcare, water, sanitation, and education. It will also prioritize localized, community-driven responses to ensure the most vulnerable populations are reached.
The LHF is a country-based, OCHA-managed pooled fund led by the UN humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon and is used complementarily to facilitate fast, effective, accountable humanitarian response. â–

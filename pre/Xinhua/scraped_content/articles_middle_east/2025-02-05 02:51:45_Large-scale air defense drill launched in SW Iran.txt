TEHRAN, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's army launched Tuesday a large-scale air defense drill in the country's southwestern regions, according to a press release published on the army's public relations website.
The drill is the second phase of a series of exercises dubbed Eqtedar (Power in Farsi), which began near Natanz, Fordow, and Khondab nuclear facilities in early January, read the press release.
The first phase involved Air Force units of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducting "all-out point defense of the nuclear sites against numerous aerial threats under tough electronic warfare conditions," state-run IRIB TV reported.
During the second-phase drill, the air defense units would conduct operations to discover, identify, track, intercept, and destroy enemy targets using homegrown radar equipment and an "expanded surveillance network," the press release added.
It noted the units identified and tracked a swarm of invading drones using air defense sensors in the drill and took the necessary tactical actions against them.
The Iranian armed forces have conducted several drills over the past few weeks. Military officials earlier said additional exercises will take place in the coming weeks to strengthen Iran's military preparedness against potential threats. â–

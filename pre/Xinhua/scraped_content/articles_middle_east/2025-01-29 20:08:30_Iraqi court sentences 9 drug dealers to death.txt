BAGHDAD, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi court on Wednesday sentenced nine drug dealers to death on charges of drug trafficking.
A statement by the Supreme Judicial Council said that the Central Criminal Court issued a verdict to execute nine drug dealers after 186 kg of various drugs were seized.
The chaos and conflicts that have engulfed Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003 impeded Iraqi governments from effectively addressing the threat of drugs.
In May 2023, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani underlined the importance of waging "a war on drugs," saying that drug dealing remains one of the main ways of financing terrorism, and the circulation of drugs flourishes in the shadow of terrorism. â–

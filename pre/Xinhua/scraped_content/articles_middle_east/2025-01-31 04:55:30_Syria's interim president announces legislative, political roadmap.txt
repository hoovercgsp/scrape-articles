DAMASCUS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Syria's newly appointed interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, outlined his administration's roadmap for the country's transition in his first address to the nation on Thursday, pledging to establish a legislative framework and a national dialogue on Syria's political future.
Speaking a day after his appointment, al-Sharaa announced the formation of a preparatory committee tasked with selecting a temporary legislative council, following the dissolution of the previous parliament.
"I will establish a preparatory committee to select a small-scale legislative council that will fill this institutional void during the transitional period," he stated.
The interim leader also revealed plans for a national dialogue conference, which he described as an "open platform for deliberations and consultations" among all segments of Syrian society to discuss the country's political program.
"In the coming days, we will announce the preparatory committee for the national dialogue conference, which will serve as a platform to exchange perspectives and refine our upcoming political program," al-Sharaa said.
Furthermore, the president pledged to issue a constitutional declaration once these initial steps are completed.
"Following these measures, we will present a constitutional declaration that will serve as the legal reference for the transitional phase," he added.
Al-Sharaa's address marks his administration's first major political initiative since taking power, signaling a move toward institutionalizing the transition process after the fall of the previous government in December last year. â–

RAMALLAH, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian presidency on Monday accused Israel of escalating military actions in the occupied West Bank, warning that ongoing operations risk further destabilization after an Israeli drone strike killed two Palestinians near Tulkarm.
In a statement, the presidency condemned Israel's intensified campaign, which included a recent assault on Tulkarm and prolonged operations in Jenin. It said the attacks had caused widespread infrastructure damage and civilian casualties, citing the deaths of 17 Palestinians in Jenin alongside mass arrests, injuries, and the destruction of homes.
"We hold the occupation authorities responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the West Bank through their attacks on our people, land, and holy sites," the presidency said, adding that such actions "will not bring security but instead fuel escalation and violence."
Earlier on Monday, Palestinian authorities and witnesses reported that an Israeli drone struck a vehicle at the entrance of the Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarm, killing two men identified by Tulkarm Governor Abdullah Kamil as Ihab Abu Atwi and Ramez Al-Damiri. The Islamist group Hamas claimed the two as members of its military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades.
The Israeli military confirmed conducting an airstrike near Tulkarm in a joint operation with the Shin Bet security agency, stating it targeted "militant infrastructure" and would provide further details later.
Violence in the West Bank has risen sharply since October 2023, with Palestinian health officials reporting more than 800 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces over the past year. Israel says its operations target militants amid increased attacks on Israelis. â–

UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres early Tuesday called on Hamas to proceed with planned release of Israeli hostages, warning renewed hostilities in Gaza must be avoided "at all costs."
"We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy," Guterres said on social media platform X.
Appealing to Hamas "to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday," Guterres said that "both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the cease-fire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase."
The Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is under increasing strain. Hamas on Monday announced the handover of hostages scheduled for Saturday would be postponed until further notice over Israeli "violations of a ceasefire agreement" in Gaza.
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened on Tuesday that if the Israeli hostages were not returned by noon on Saturday, the ceasefire would end and Israeli army would resume "intensive fighting" in the war-torn enclave. â–

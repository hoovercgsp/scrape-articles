BAGHDAD, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Friday's airstrikes on Islamic State (IS) militants in the Zarga area between the provinces of Salahudin and Kirkuk rose to seven, the Iraqi military said on Sunday.
A security force dispatched early Sunday morning to search the bombed IS hideout found the bodies of seven militants, some of them wearing explosive belts, along with various weapons, logistical supplies, and other materials, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
It added that the killed IS militants would be identified later.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

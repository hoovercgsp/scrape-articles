GAZA, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- A 14-year-old Palestinian was killed on Thursday when an unexploded Israeli rocket detonated in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.
Palestinian security sources told Xinhua that a team of explosive engineers were attempting to dismantle the rocket, which was deemed a safety hazard when it suddenly exploded.
"The blast resulted in the death of a 14-year-old child who was present at the scene," the sources added.
Al-Awda Hospital in the camp confirmed the child's death, whose body was brought to the hospital following the explosion.
The incident occurred amid a crisis that threatened to collapse the fragile truce between Hamas and Israel. Hamas said Thursday it would release three more hostages on Saturday as agreed and reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement following talks with mediators. However, Israel denied that any understanding had been reached and did not withdraw its threat to resume attacks on Gaza. â–

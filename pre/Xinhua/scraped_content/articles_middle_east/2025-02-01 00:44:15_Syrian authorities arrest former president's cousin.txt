DAMASCUS, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian authorities have arrested Atef Najib, former political security chief in the city of Daraa, in a security operation in the coastal province of Latakia, state news agency SANA reported Friday, citing a local official.
According to Mustafa Knaifati, director of general security in Latakia, Najib was detained in a "high-level operation" jointly conducted by security and military forces.
"Najib is implicated in crimes against the Syrian people," Knaifati said in a statement.
"His arrest is part of our ongoing efforts to hold accountable those responsible for violations and to strengthen security and stability in the region," he said.
Najib, a cousin of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, played a key role in the government's response to protests in Daraa in 2011, an event widely seen as a trigger for the Syrian civil conflict.
Authorities confirmed that Najib has been transferred to the relevant judicial bodies for prosecution. â–

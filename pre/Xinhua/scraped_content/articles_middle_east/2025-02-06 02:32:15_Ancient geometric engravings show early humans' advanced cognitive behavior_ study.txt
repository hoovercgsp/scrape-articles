JERUSALEM, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- An international research team has uncovered new evidence of advanced cognitive and symbolic behavior among early humans, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement on Wednesday.
In a study published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, researchers from Israel, Germany, the United States, and Portugal examined incised stone artifacts from Levantine Middle Palaeolithic caves in northern Israel.
The findings revealed that certain artifacts were deliberately engraved with geometric patterns, signaling the presence of abstract thinking and symbolic behavior. In contrast, other artifacts with shallow, unpatterned incisions appear to have been used functionally, possibly as tools for abrasion.
These highlighted the intentionality behind the engravings, shedding new light on the cognitive and cultural complexity of early human societies.
Traditionally, such markings were mostly thought of as functional, created through tool use or natural wear. The prevailing belief was that symbolic behavior emerged much later in human evolution, specifically with modern humans.
However, the new study challenged that view, providing evidence of symbolic engravings long before modern humans began global colonization.
Using advanced 3D surface analysis, the team identified geometric patterns aligned with the topography of the surfaces, emphasizing their aesthetic and symbolic intent. The deliberate nature of these engravings suggests that early human societies possessed advanced conceptual abilities.
The study highlighted the intentionality of these marks, while also providing a new comparative framework for analyzing similar artifacts, offering crucial insights into the cognitive development of early hominins and their capacity for abstract thought and symbolic expression. â–

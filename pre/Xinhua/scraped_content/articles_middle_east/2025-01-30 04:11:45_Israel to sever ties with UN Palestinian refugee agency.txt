JERUSALEM, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel said on Wednesday it would sever all ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) starting on Thursday, accusing the agency of employing Hamas operatives and enabling "terror activity" in Gaza.
"UNRWA is riddled with Hamas," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said on social media platform X. "Beginning Jan. 30, Israel will cease all engagement with UNRWA in accordance with Israeli law," he wrote.
Marmorstein reiterated Israel's commitment to humanitarian aid reaching Gaza but said assistance would be channeled through "alternative organizations," including other UN agencies, international NGOs, and foreign governments.
An Israeli law passed in October 2024 mandates an end to UNRWA's operation on Israeli land -- including East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in a move not recognized internationally -- and contact with Israeli authorities from Thursday. It also bars Israeli officials from any contact with UNRWA. The move has drawn condemnation from international leaders and aid groups.
UNRWA, which provides vital healthcare, education, and emergency services to millions of Palestinians, denied the allegations and said it has received no formal evidence from Israel to substantiate the claims.
UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on Tuesday that the agency has been the target of a "fierce disinformation campaign" to "portray the agency as a terrorist organization." â–

ABU DHABI, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Thursday strongly condemned an attack by the Israeli military on the city of Jenin in the West Bank, calling for international action to halt ongoing violations and prevent further escalation.
In a statement, the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the global community to assume its responsibilities in ending Israel's "continuous violations," emphasizing the urgent need for collective efforts to safeguard civilians and uphold international law.
The ministry called for an immediate ceasefire to prevent further casualties and mitigate regional tensions, pointing up the necessity of advancing peace initiatives to achieve a comprehensive and just resolution to the conflict.
The statement reiterated the UAE's unwavering support for the Palestinian people and stressed the need for an end to the practices undermining the two-state solution.
For the past three days, the Israeli army has been conducting a large-scale military operation in Jenin and its surrounding refugee camp, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens of others, according to figures released by the Israeli military and official Palestinian news agency WAFA. â–

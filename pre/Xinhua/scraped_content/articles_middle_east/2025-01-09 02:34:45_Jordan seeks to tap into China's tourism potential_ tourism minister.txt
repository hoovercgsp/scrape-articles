AMMAN, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Lina Annab underscored the significance of the Chinese tourism market on Wednesday, describing it as one of the world's most promising sectors and a key target for Jordan's tourism strategy.
Speaking to Xinhua, Annab said that Jordan is setting its sights on the Chinese tourism market, viewing it as a promising avenue for growth in the coming years.
The Chinese market is regarded as one of the most significant globally, offering opportunities to attract a wide range of tourists due to China's cultural diversity and large population with an interest in global exploration, the minister noted.
She added that while the Chinese market is crucial, it remains relatively new for Jordan. Historically, the country's tourism strategies have been more focused on attracting visitors from Western markets. However, there is a growing recognition of the potential in the East, with China emerging as a key target for tourism development.
Jordan's tourism ministry has already launched marketing initiatives to engage the Chinese market, according to Annab, who noted that campaigns conducted last year, featuring programs and exhibitions tailored to Chinese travelers, showed encouraging results.
Building on this foundation, the ministry plans to expand these efforts this year, reflecting the market's growing importance, she said.
As part of these initiatives, discussions are planned with Royal Jordanian airlines to establish direct flight routes between Jordan and China. The ministry is also encouraging Chinese airlines to consider opening routes to Jordan, seeing potential benefits for both tourism operators and carriers. Improved air connectivity is viewed as a critical step in making Jordan more accessible to Chinese travelers.
Tourism is a vital pillar of Jordan's economy, contributing around 12.5 percent of the kingdom's GDP through trade, restaurants, and hotels. In the first 11 months of 2024, the sector generated 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, according to the Central Bank of Jordan. â–

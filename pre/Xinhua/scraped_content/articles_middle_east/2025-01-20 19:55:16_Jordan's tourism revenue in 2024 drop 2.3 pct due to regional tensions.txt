AMMAN, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's tourism revenue in 2024 totaled 5.13 billion Jordanian dinars (7.24 billion U.S. dollars), marking a 2.3-percent decline from the record high revenue achieved the previous year, Tourism and Antiquities Minister Lina Annab announced here Monday.
The number of tourists visiting the country reached nearly 6.11 million in 2024, registering a 3.9-percent decrease compared to 2023, Annab told a parliamentary Tourism Committee meeting, according to the state-run broadcaster Al Mamlaka.
Annab attributed the decline to the Gaza conflict and other regional tensions.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which extended throughout 2024, has significantly impacted the region's tourism sector. â–

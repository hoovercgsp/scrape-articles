BEIRUT, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will take part in Lebanon's reconstruction efforts following the damage caused by the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, Iraqi Undersecretary of the Ministry of Commerce Sattar Al-Jabri said in Lebanon on Tuesday.
According to a statement from Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA), Al-Jabri made the remarks during a meeting with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.
"The Iraqi government is committed to supporting the Lebanese people by focusing on a specific sector -- whether healthcare or education -- or the reconstruction of certain areas to aid Lebanon's recovery," said Al-Jabri.
He said a committee formed by the Iraqi Cabinet will assess the affected areas and submit a report to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani.
"While several countries may contribute to Lebanon's reconstruction, Iraq will be fully engaged in this effort," said he while emphasizing Iraq's active role in the rebuilding process.
Al-Jabri added that the Iraqi relief committee has prepared around 30,000 food baskets, which will be distributed across Lebanon starting Wednesday to aid those in need and those affected by the war.
He also highlighted Iraq's continued commitment to Lebanon, noting that substantial aid had already been provided and reaffirming the government's dedication to sustaining support for the Lebanese people. â–

SANAA, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said Thursday that his group "will launch attacks against the United States and Israel" if U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to force Palestinians out of Gaza is imposed.
"If the Americans and Israelis try to implement Trump's plan by force or agree with the Arab regimes to implement it, we will intervene by military force," al-Houthi said in a televised speech aired by his group's satellite TV channel, al-Masirah.
"We will intervene with missile strikes, drones, naval operations, and other means if the Americans and Israelis move to implement the displacement plan against Palestinians," he said.
The new threat came a few days after al-Houthi vowed if the war resumes in Gaza and southern Lebanon, then his group will resume rocket and drone attacks against the Israeli cities.
Earlier, Trump proposed that the United States should take control of Gaza and that the Palestinians be relocated to neighboring Jordan and Egypt, which has been widely condemned. â–

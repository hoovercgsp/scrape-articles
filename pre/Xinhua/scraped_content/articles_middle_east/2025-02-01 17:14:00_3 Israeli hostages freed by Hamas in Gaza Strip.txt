GAZA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, on Saturday handed over three hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza City.
Earlier in the day, two hostages, Israeli-French citizen Ofer Calderon, 54, and Israeli civilian Yarden Bibas, 35, were transferred to the Red Cross and from there to Israeli forces who brought them to Israeli territory. The third hostage was 65-year-old Israeli-U.S. dual national Keith Siegel.
The release, conducted as part of the fourth batch under the first phase of the prisoner exchange and ceasefire deal, was coordinated with international mediators to ensure a safe transfer.
The exchange was part of the efforts to implement a negotiated agreement to facilitate the release of detainees on both sides while maintaining a temporary cessation of hostilities.
According to Palestinian sources, further developments on the deal's implementation are expected in the coming days. â–

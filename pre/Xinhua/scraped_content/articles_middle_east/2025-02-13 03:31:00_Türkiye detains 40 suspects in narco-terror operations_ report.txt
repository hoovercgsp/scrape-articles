ISTANBUL, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities have detained 40 suspects, including alleged members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulen movement, in a series of anti-narcotics and counter-terrorism operations in the western province of Izmir, state-run Anadolu Agency reported on Wednesday.
The coordinated raids, conducted by counter-narcotics, intelligence, counter-terrorism, and anti-smuggling units, targeted locations in central Izmir and the Menemen district. Anadolu did not specify the timing of the operations.
Authorities seized 8,277 synthetic drug pills, 77 grams of marijuana, four unlicensed pistols, and a rifle during the raids. The detained individuals are believed to be involved in drug-related activities linked to both the PKK and the Gulen movement.
The PKK, recognized as a terrorist group by Türkiye, the United States, and the European Union, has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state for over 30 years.
Türkiye accuses Fethullah Gulen, the influential Turkish cleric who lived in self-exile in the United States until his death in October 2024, and his network of orchestrating the failed coup attempt in July 2016. The attempt resulted in the deaths of 249 people and left around 2,200 others injured. ■

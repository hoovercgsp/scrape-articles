ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The UN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA) reported on Wednesday that 41 civilians were killed and 52 others injured by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) in Yemen's western province of Hodeidah throughout 2024.
According to a UNMHA statement, a total of 61 incidents involving landmines and ERW were documented in the Red Sea port province last year, with women and children accounting for 40 percent of related casualties.
Hodeidah's southern districts of Ad Durayhimi, Al Hali, and At Tuhayat recorded the highest numbers of casualties, said the statement.
UNMHA, established in January 2019, is mandated to oversee the cessation of military activities in Hodeidah.
Large swaths of Yemen have been contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance since the beginning of the civil war in late 2014 after Houthi militants seized the capital Sanaa.
The Yemeni government has accused the Houthi group of planting over 2 million landmines, posing a significant threat to civilians even after the cessation of hostilities. â–

DOHA, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said on Tuesday that approximately 300,000 citizens have returned from southern Gaza to their homes in the northern part of the strip.
During the weekly media briefing, Al Ansari highlighted that Hamas has provided mediators with critical information about hostages.
He noted that this development had resolved several issues previously impeding Israeli authorities from permitting displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.
"We are working closely with our Egyptian partners through the joint Qatari-Egyptian committee to ensure the safe transfer of citizens back to the north," he added.
He revealed that progress has been made in the agreement concerning hostages, confirming that Israeli hostage Arbel Yehud and two others will be released before Friday. â–

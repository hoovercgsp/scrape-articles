BEIRUT, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Civil Defense Directorate said in a statement on Monday that the remains of 11 bodies were retrieved from the rubble of destroyed houses in southern Lebanon.
Ten bodies were discovered "from the village of Tayr Harfa, in addition to the remains of a martyr from the southwest village of Chamaa," said the statement.
"The remains were transferred to Jabal Amel Hospital to conduct the necessary laboratory tests, including DNA tests, to determine the identities of the martyrs," it added.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's official National News Agency said that the Israeli forces continued their extensive operations in blowing up homes and infrastructure in the village of Aita al-Shaab, in the Bint Jbeil district, central sector of southern Lebanon.
"Plumes of smoke rose in the village's sky, and the sound of explosions was heard in the district's towns," said the report.
"The destruction of homes and infrastructure also affected the villages of Chamaa, Tayr Harfa, Mays al-Jabal and al-Bayada in western southern Lebanon," it added.
A ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, went into effect on Nov. 27, aiming to halt nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
Despite the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli army still carries out strikes in Lebanon, some of which resulted in deaths and injuries. â–

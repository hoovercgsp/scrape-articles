DAMASCUS, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim Defense Ministry has reportedly agreed with the majority of armed factions on forming a unified army, local online newspaper Al-Watan reported Monday.
The arrangement includes an accord with factions of the so-called Syrian National Army in the north, laying out a plan for their integration into the revamped national forces.
According to the report, the ministry has rejected any sectarian, religious, or regional autonomy for armed groups.
Instead, it aims to build a unified, professional army composed of volunteers rather than conscripts, an official from the ministry was quoted as saying.
The ministry also plans to integrate the former Free Syrian Army into the defense structure. The Free Syrian Army was a coalition of defected Syrian military personnel and civilian fighters formed in 2011 to oppose the former government during the civil war.
Al-Watan Online noted that this preliminary plan followed extensive talks between defense officials and various factions. Negotiations with remaining armed groups are expected to continue in the coming weeks as Damascus moves toward forming what it calls "a solid national army." â–

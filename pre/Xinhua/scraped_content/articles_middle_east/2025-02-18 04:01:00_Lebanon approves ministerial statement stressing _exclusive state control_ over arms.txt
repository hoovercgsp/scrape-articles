BEIRUT, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's cabinet approved a ministerial statement on Monday asserting the "exclusive state control over arms," amid long-standing tensions over Hezbollah's independent military presence, the National News Agency reported.
The statement declares the government as the sole entity authorized to possess weapons and enforce security in the country.
The cabinet also reaffirmed Lebanon's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which requires the disarmament of all non-state actors in southern Lebanon and the deployment of state forces along the Israeli border.
After the cabinet session, Information Minister Paul Morcos told reporters that the statement emphasizes the government's commitment to liberating all Lebanese territories while asserting the state's exclusive right to bear arms. He added that the statement affirms Lebanon's adherence to Resolution 1701 and its policy of neutrality in regional conflicts.
The ministerial statement also calls for serious dialogue with Syria and stresses that Lebanon should not serve as a platform for hostility against neighboring countries. â–

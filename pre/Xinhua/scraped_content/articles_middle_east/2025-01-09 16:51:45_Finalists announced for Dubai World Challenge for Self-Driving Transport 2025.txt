DUBAI, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) on Wednesday announced the five finalists for the 4th Dubai World Challenge for Self-Driving Transport 2025.
Two consortiums with participation from Chinese entities, including the WeRide / Deutsche Bahn Consortium, comprising organizations from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Germany and China, and the Orcauboat / PIXMOVING / Heriot-Watt University Dubai Consortium, a partnership involving teams from the UAE and China, are among the finalists.
Other finalists include the BrightDrive / eVersum / Shiptec / SeaBubbles Consortium, which brings together expertise from Switzerland, France, the UAE and Austria, the SURAA / Arti Consortium from Austria, and the company Zelos from Singapore.
This year, the challenge requires participants to design a model district that integrates multiple transport modes, enabling residents to choose their preferred means of mobility while ensuring exceptional service quality. The winners will be revealed at the Dubai World Congress and Challenge for Self-Driving Transport, set to take place in September.
As the first global event of its kind, the challenge has become a premier international platform for advancing autonomous transport technologies, said Mattar Al Tayer, director general and chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, adding that this year's competition drew an unprecedented level of interest, with submissions exceeding the target by 170 percent. â–

ISTANBUL, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police on Monday detained 17 physicians in a mass operation targeting suspects linked to a network accused of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, state-run TRT reported.
The police launched a simultaneous operation across ten provinces and arrested those suspects who had been actively working as doctors.
The investigation focused on student dormitories operated by the network and the study services they provided for the Medical Specialization Examination.
During searches at the addresses, a large number of digital materials and organizational documents were seized.
The Gulen network, led by and named after Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen who died last October in the United States, has been accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the coup attempt in 2016, which resulted in the deaths of over 250 people. â–

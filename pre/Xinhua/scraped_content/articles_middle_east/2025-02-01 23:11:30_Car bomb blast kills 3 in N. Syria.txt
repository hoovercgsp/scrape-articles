DAMASCUS, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb explosion rocked the city of Manbij in northern Syria on Saturday, killing at least three people, state-run Al-Ekhbaria TV reported.
According to the report, the blast occurred near Sufaina Roundabout in central Manbij, a key urban hub in Aleppo province's eastern region, which has witnessed recurring violence in recent weeks.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, and Syrian authorities have yet to release an official statement regarding the bombing.
The explosion is the latest in a string of security incidents in Manbij, where tensions have escalated amid ongoing clashes between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Türkiye-backed factions. ■

TEHRAN, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi on Saturday exchanged views in a phone call over Gaza's ceasefire agreement with Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Ziyad al-Nakhalah.
During the talk, Araghchi congratulated the Palestinian people on the "victory of their unparalleled resistance in the face of Israel's genocide and heinous crimes" over the past 15 months, adding their resistance eventually forced Israel to "surrender and accept the ceasefire agreement," according to a statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
Araghchi also highlighted Iran's "principled and fixed" position of supporting the Palestinians' cause and "legitimate and legal resistance" against Israelis.
The PIJ's chief, for his part, presented a report of the latest field situation in Gaza and the relevant political developments, praising Iran for its "courageous" stances in support of the people of Gaza.
Al-Nakhalah stressed that Palestinians would continue their resistance and efforts to restore their human and legal rights, gain control over their fate, and "end the occupiers' domination."
Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed on a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The agreement includes an initial 42-day phase, during which the more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt, and 33 hostages held in Gaza will be released. â–

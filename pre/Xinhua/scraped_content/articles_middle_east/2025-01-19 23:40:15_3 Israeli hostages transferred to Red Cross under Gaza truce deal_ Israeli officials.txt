JERUSALEM, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel confirmed on Sunday afternoon that Hamas transferred three female Israeli hostages to the Red Cross in Gaza, as a ceasefire deal took effect, more than 15 months after they were abducted during Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023.
Israel's military and Shin Bet domestic security agency said in a joint statement that the Red Cross informed them the three hostages were "on their way" to a meeting point with Israeli forces in Gaza. From there, they will be taken to a military post on the Israeli side of the Gaza border, where they will reunite with their families before being flown by military helicopter to a hospital outside Tel Aviv.
The Red Cross updated Israel that an initial medical examination indicated the hostages were in "good" condition.
This marked the first release of hostages under a three-phase deal that halted the fighting that began in October 2023. A total of 90 Palestinian detainees are set to be released from Israeli jails later on Sunday. Under the agreement, 33 hostages are expected to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees. â–

ANKARA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will visit Ankara on Tuesday at the invitation of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Türkiye's Presidential Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said on Monday.
Al-Sharaa, along with other high-level Syrian officials, is expected to discuss with the Turkish side the recent developments in Syria and joint steps to promote Syria's economic recovery, sustainable stability, and security, Altun said on social media platform X.
Meetings held during al-Sharaa's visit will also focus on support mechanisms for Syria's transitional government and its people through multilateral platforms, he added.
"We believe that the visit ... will contribute to strengthening and expanding the renewed Türkiye-Syria relations," Altun noted.
Türkiye, which severed diplomatic relations with Damascus in 2011, has voiced support for a peaceful transition in Syria. Erdogan has pledged to back the new Syrian administration in establishing state structures and drafting a new constitution.
On Sunday, al-Sharaa arrived in Saudi Arabia for his first foreign visit. During his visit, al-Sharaa held talks with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud on topics related to Syria and regional affairs, according to the Saudi Press Agency. ■

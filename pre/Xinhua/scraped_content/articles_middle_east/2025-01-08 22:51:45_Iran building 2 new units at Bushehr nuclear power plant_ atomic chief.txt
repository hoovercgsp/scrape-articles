TEHRAN, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's atomic chief has said the country is building two new units at a nuclear power plant in the southern province of Bushehr, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency.
President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Mohammad Eslami made the remarks in a meeting with a group of Iranian lawmakers in the capital Tehran on Tuesday.
Eslami noted that 5,000 people were working "round the clock and at full capacity" to construct the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant's units No. 2 and 3 in line with the target of achieving a threefold increase in the country's nuclear electricity generation.
The first unit of the power plant had made significant progress over the past few years, having generated over 7.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, he said.
Eslami added that a precise planning had been done to construct nuclear power plants in Iran's southern provinces of Bushehr, Khuzestan, Hormozgan and Sistan and Baluchestan as well as northern province of Golestan to raise the country's nuclear electricity generation to 20,000 megawatts by 2042. â–

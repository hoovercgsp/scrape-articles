DAMASCUS, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Wednesday they repelled a major offensive by Turkish-backed fighters in northern Syria, claiming that at least 37 attackers were killed.
The clashes erupted in Manbij city in the northern Aleppo province when Turkish-backed forces launched a broad assault under cover of warplanes and drones on the villages of Aloush and Tel Arish, as well as on Seriatel Hill, all within the vicinity of Tishreen Dam in southeastern Mabij city, the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces said in a statement.
SDF fighters allegedly destroyed a tank and five military transport vehicles, and damaged three additional armored vehicles, said the statement.
Meanwhile, the SDF said six of its own fighters were killed and nine others injured in the fighting.
Fight near Manbij has been intensified since the collapse of Bashar Assad's government in December, with various factions vying to consolidate control and influence across northern Syria. The Tishreen Dam, located along the Euphrates River, is considered a key strategic site in the ongoing conflict. â–

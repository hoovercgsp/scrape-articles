JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli deputy company commander and another soldier were killed, and two others were injured, in a clash with militants in northern Gaza, the Israeli military said on Monday.
The military identified one of the dead as Eitan Israel Shiknazi, 24, from the settlement of Eli in the West Bank, a deputy company commander in the infantry Nahal Brigade's 932nd Battalion. He "fell during combat" in the northern Gazan city of Beit Hanoun, the military said in a statement.
The name of the other fatality was not released because his family had not yet been notified, the military said, adding that he and the two injured soldiers also belonged to the 932nd Battalion.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV reported that the four soldiers were hit by an anti-tank missile fired by militants at the building where they were staying.
The latest deaths brought the total number of Israeli soldiers killed to 827 since the beginning of the country's multi-front war in October 2023.
According to the Gaza health authorities on Monday, Israeli strikes have killed 45,854 people and injured 109,139 others in the Palestinian enclave since the conflict. â–

ANKARA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier jointly rejected proposals to displace Palestinians from Gaza on Wednesday, reaffirming their support for a two-state solution in opposition to recent U.S. suggestions.
"Proposals to deport or exile Palestinians from the Gaza Strip are unacceptable under international law," Steinmeier said at a joint press conference in Ankara, referring to the proposal made by U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday to relocate millions of Palestinians in Gaza.
The German president emphasized his country's continued backing of a two-state solution, particularly in future discussions with the U.S. administration.
Erdogan underscored the international community's responsibility to maintain the ceasefire and work toward implementing a two-state solution, as the two leaders discussed regional cooperation on Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine.
"Today's consultations are vital for our joint efforts toward peace and stability in our neighboring regions," Erdogan said, highlighting Türkiye's ongoing collaboration with Germany.
Addressing Syria's future, Erdogan expressed hope for German support in reconstruction efforts, while Steinmeier acknowledged Türkiye's strategic importance in securing regional peace.
The leaders also discussed the Ukraine conflict, with Erdogan reiterating his long-standing call for "a fair and lasting peace." ■

RAMALLAH/CAIRO, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli authorities on Saturday released 200 Palestinian prisoners as part of the second phase of a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas.
Abdullah Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, said the prisoners were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Some prisoners were released into the West Bank from Ofer Prison while others bound for Gaza or deportation abroad were released from Negev Prison in southern Israel.
Palestinian officials in the Ramallah Governorate also coordinated the release.
According to eyewitnesses, the prisoners were transferred from the ICRC to a medical center in Ramallah, where the Palestinian security forces were stationed in preparation for the release.
Among those released, 16 headed to Gaza. Palestinian security sources and eyewitnesses told Xinhua that the prisoners entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing southeast of the strip.
According to the Palestinian Prisoners' Affairs Authority, the 200 prisoners included 121 who had been serving life sentences and 79 others with long sentences.
Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported later in the day that some 70 Palestinian prisoners the Israeli authorities had released arrived in Egypt via the Rafah crossing. Türkiye, Tunisia, and Algeria have agreed to take in some prisoners while others will stay in Egypt.
Following the release of the prisoners, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said in a press statement that the Palestinians in Gaza are waiting for the Israeli army to "withdraw according to the terms of the agreement and for the displaced residents to begin returning to their lands and homes." ■

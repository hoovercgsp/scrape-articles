DUBAI, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The UAE National Olympic Committee on Sunday announced the country's participation in the 9th Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin, China, from February 7 to 14.
This marks the UAE's third participation in the Asian Winter Games and the largest delegation to date. Athletes will compete in three disciplines: alpine skiing, freestyle skiing and snowboarding.

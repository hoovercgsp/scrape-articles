GAZA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli artillery strike on Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Thursday, Gaza's civil defense said, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.
Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense, said Israeli forces targeted a group of Palestinians in the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood west of Rafah. He confirmed two deaths and several injuries, with the wounded taken to a local hospital.
Palestinian security sources told Xinhua the strike hit an area designated as a safe zone under the ceasefire terms, which had allowed residents to return.
The Israeli military has not commented on the incident. It is the latest reported breach of the truce, following previous claims of Israeli actions in Gaza.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said in a statement it had engaged armed suspects in Gaza, citing perceived threats to its troops. It said it had "neutralized" Akram Zanon, a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, and claimed to have responded to individuals approaching military positions in multiple locations.
Also in the statement, the Israeli military reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire but stressed its readiness for further developments and urged Palestinian civilians to avoid military zones and follow safety instructions.
The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, took effect on Sunday. The deal outlines a phased roadmap to de-escalation. In the first 42-day phase, Hamas is required to release 33 Israeli hostages, while Israel is to free over 1,890 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. â–

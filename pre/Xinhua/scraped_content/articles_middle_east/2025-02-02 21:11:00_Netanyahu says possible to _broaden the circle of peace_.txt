JERUSALEM, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- It is possible to strengthen security and expand peace, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday before departing for Washington, where he will negotiate the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.
"I believe that we can strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength," he said before boarding his flight.
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday to discuss issues of Gaza, Israeli hostages, the Middle East and the entire world, his office said in a statement.
Netanyahu will also meet with Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, to coordinate positions on the next phase of the ceasefire. Witkoff will then talk with officials from Qatar and Egypt, who had mediated the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a three-phase ceasefire deal in January, under which Hamas has so far released 18 hostages and Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
According to Israeli figures, over 70 hostages are still being held in Gaza. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli female soldier was freed by Gaza militants on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
A live broadcast showed Agam Berger, 20, entering a Red Cross vehicle in Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip, surrounded by Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants.
"The returning hostage is currently being accompanied by IDF special forces and Shin Bet forces on her return to Israeli territory, where she will undergo an initial medical assessment," the military said.
Later on Thursday, Hamas is expected to release two more Israeli hostages, as well as five Thai hostages, while Israel would release another 110 Palestinian prisoners in the third exchange since a ceasefire in Gaza took effect last week. â–

BEIRUT/JERUSALEM, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and four others injured on Friday in an Israeli airstrike targeting Tayr Debba, a municipality in southern Lebanon's Tyre district, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported.
According to the official National News Agency, an Israeli drone targeted a car in Tayr Debba, killing five and wounding four more, all of whom have been transferred to hospitals in Tyre.
Separately, the General Directorate of Civil Defense on Friday announced the recovery of five bodies it said were killed during recent Israeli strikes on the Lebanese town of Khiam, east of southern Lebanon.
Despite a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024, Israel has conducted intermittent strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, some of which have caused casualties.
Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Friday that Israeli aircraft struck a vehicle loaded with weapons belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
The airstrike was launched after the IDF found several militants loading weapons onto the truck, according to the statement.
Earlier in the day, the IDF said in a separate statement that during searching operations in a southern Lebanese village, Israeli soldiers discovered a multi-barrel rocket launcher, hundreds of mortar shells, explosive devices, and RPG rifles inside a structure. It added that anti-tank fire positions and hidden weapons were also located nearby.
During another operation, Israeli troops found a weapons storage facility containing dozens of shoulder-launched missiles, explosive charges, and extensive military equipment, the IDF said, adding that all the weapons were either confiscated or dismantled. â–

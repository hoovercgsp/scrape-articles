MUSCAT, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The 8th Indian Ocean Conference commenced here on Sunday to explore opportunities and challenges on maritime trade and security, renewable energy, and technological innovation, Oman's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The two-day event under the theme "Voyage to New Horizons of Maritime Partnership," organized by the ministry in collaboration with India Foundation, has attracted global ministers and experts in maritime, economic, and diplomatic affairs, according to the statement.
"The Indian Ocean is not merely a body of water but a major economic artery, a platform for trade exchange, and a bridge connecting nations," the statement quoted Oman's Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Al Busaidi's remarks at the opening ceremony as saying.
Partnerships among Indian Ocean countries extend beyond maritime affairs to include energy, technology, and sustainable development, which are essential to ensuring the security and prosperity of the Indian Ocean, Al Busaidi said.
Oman is committed to fostering dialogue, respecting multilateralism, seeking common ground rather than differences, and building an inclusive partnership that guarantees equitable opportunities for all, he said.
Launched in 2016 by the India Foundation in Singapore with participation from 30 countries, the conference has since served as a platform for countries from the region and beyond to discuss issues including security, economic cooperation, and environmental challenges. â–

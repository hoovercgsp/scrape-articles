JERUSALEM, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's government on Sunday approved Eyal Zamir as the country's new military chief, following the resignation of his predecessor Herzi Halevi in January over his failure to prevent the Hamas attack on October 2023.
A government statement said Zamir's appointment was unanimously approved.
Zamir, 59, has served as director general of the Defense Ministry for the past two years and will officially assume his new role in early March.
During his 38-year career in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Zamir has held several senior positions, including IDF deputy chief of staff, commander of IDF Southern Command, and military secretary to the prime minister.
Halevi resigned on January 21, two days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas took effect in the Gaza Strip following more than 15 months of fighting. Under the truce deal, 24 hostages held by Hamas and other Palestinian factions in the strip have been released so far in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails. â–

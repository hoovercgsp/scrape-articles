JERUSALEM, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military said Sunday it has expanded its major campaign in the northern occupied West Bank.
Overnight, Israeli troops raided the town of Tammun, north of Nablus, where an Israeli airstrike killed 10 militants last week, a military spokesperson said in a statement, adding the troops found an M-16 rifle and magazines.
According to the spokesperson, Israeli troops were preparing to raid four more towns and villages in the area, and a raid in Jenin, further north in the West Bank, was ongoing.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that Israeli ground troops and bulldozers raided the area, forcing several families to leave their homes on the outskirts of the town. Bulldozers erected earth mounds, blocking the main road leading to the town.
Also on Sunday, a 73-year-old Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the Jenin refugee camp, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported.
Israel launched its largest military operation in Jenin in years on Jan. 21, calling it a "counterterrorism operation." At least 25 people have been killed by Israeli forces since the offensive began, according to Palestinian figures. â–

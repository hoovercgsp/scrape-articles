TEHRAN, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Culture Minister Seyyed Abbas Salehi said on Sunday that Iran and Saudi Arabia could promote relations in the fields of culture, art and media.
He made the remarks at a press conference in the capital Tehran while answering a question about Iran's possible cultural cooperation with Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
With the resumption of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023, "better horizons" were seen in bilateral ties, Salehi said.
The Iranian minister also said Iran had established "good" political relations with Egypt, stressing that Tehran-Cairo ties would also move towards an "appropriate" direction step by step.
Iran and Saudi Arabia formally declared the resumption of diplomatic relations with immediate effect in April 2023. â–

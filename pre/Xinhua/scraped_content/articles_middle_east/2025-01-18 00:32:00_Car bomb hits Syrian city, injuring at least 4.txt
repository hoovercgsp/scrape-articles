DAMASCUS, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb exploded on Friday in a contested city in the eastern countryside of the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, a war monitor reported.
The explosive-laden vehicle went off in the center of the city of Manbij.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the incident marks the fifth bombing in areas recently captured by Turkish-backed factions.
Local media said at least four people were injured in the blast, which also caused property damage.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Fighting between Turkish-backed fighters and Kurdish-led groups has intensified near Manbij since the collapse of Bashar Assad's government in December. â–

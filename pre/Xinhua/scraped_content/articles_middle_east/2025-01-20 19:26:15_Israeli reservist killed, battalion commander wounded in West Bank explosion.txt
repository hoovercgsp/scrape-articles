JERUSALEM, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli reservist soldier was killed, and a battalion commander seriously injured when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said on Monday.
The Israeli troops were patrolling the Palestinian town of Tammun, south of Jenin, when their jeep hit the explosive device around midnight between Sunday and Monday.
The reservist, identified as 31-year-old Eviatar Ben Yehuda, was killed in the explosion. The officer seated next to him sustained serious injuries and was evacuated to a hospital for treatment, the military said.
The incident occurred amid escalating tensions in the West Bank, as Israel continues daily raids in Palestinian cities and towns, often resulting in Palestinian casualties. It came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect, halting more than 15 months of an Israeli onslaught in Gaza. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Saturday that it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen toward southeastern Israel.
Sirens were activated in the southernmost Red Sea city of Eilat and the Arava Valley following the missile launch. According to the IDF, the missile was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, and no casualties were reported.
This marked the second missile fired by Yemen's Houthi group towards Israel on Saturday, following an earlier launch aimed at central Israel, which was also intercepted by Israel's air defense systems.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV News reported that fragments from the first missile interception were found by police in four locations across central Israel, with no casualties or damage resulting from the event.
On Thursday, Yemen's Houthi group's leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, said his group would continue launching attacks against Israel if strikes continue on Gaza. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Security Agency (ISA) has instructed Israeli airlines to cancel flights to the resort city of Paphos, western Cyprus, due to security concerns, Israel's state-owned Kan TV News reported on Sunday night.
Until further notice, flights from Tel Aviv to Paphos have been diverted to Larnaca, situated in the southeastern part of the Mediterranean island nation, according to the TV report.
The ISA stated that "the decision to concentrate flights to and from Cyprus at Larnaca International Airport is based on various security considerations" but did not elaborate further.
The directive to divert flights applies to Israeli airlines El Al, Israir, and Arkia. According to Kan, the airlines have arranged buses to transport passengers from Larnaca to Paphos.
Paphos, only an hour's flight from Tel Aviv, is a popular destination for Israeli tourists. The flight route is also used by many Israelis who have relocated to the city. â–

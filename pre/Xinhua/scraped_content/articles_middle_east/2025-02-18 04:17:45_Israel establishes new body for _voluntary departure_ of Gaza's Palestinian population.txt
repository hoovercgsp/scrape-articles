JERUSALEM, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has ordered the establishment of a new government directorate to promote the "voluntary departure" of Gaza's Palestinian population, the Defense Ministry said Monday.
Consisting of representatives from different government ministries and security agencies, the directorate will operate within the Defense Ministry and be "dedicated to facilitating" the departure process, according to a statement from the ministry.
"The plan includes extensive assistance to enable any Gaza resident who wishes to emigrate voluntarily to a third country to receive a support package, which includes, among other things, special exit arrangements via sea, air, and land," it said.
The decision followed a meeting of senior Israeli security officials earlier in the day.
The move echoes U.S. President Donald Trump's recent plan to transfer Gaza's Palestinian population to neighboring countries. Trump stated that Gazans who left would not be allowed to return. Katz and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have expressed strong support for the plan, while Palestinians and Arab leaders have condemned it. â–

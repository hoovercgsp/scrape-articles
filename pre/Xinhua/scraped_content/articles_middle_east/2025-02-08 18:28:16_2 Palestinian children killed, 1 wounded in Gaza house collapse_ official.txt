GAZA, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian children were killed and another one was injured on Saturday when a concrete wall collapsed in a house severely damaged by a previous Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, a Palestinian official said.
In a press statement, Salama Marouf, head of the Hamas-run Gaza-based media office, said, "This tragic incident highlights the dangers threatening civilian lives, particularly children, due to the ongoing prevention of heavy equipment and necessary fuel from entering Gaza to remove debris and secure damaged areas."
Marouf called for an immediate approval of technical teams to assess and reinforce partially damaged homes, warning that failure to address the situation could result in further casualties.
"The toll of victims due to delays in rescue operations and reconstruction must end," he noted.
Gaza faces deteriorating humanitarian conditions due to the blockade and border closures, which hinder relief and reconstruction efforts, posing a direct threat to the lives of civilians in the region. â–

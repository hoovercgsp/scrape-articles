JERUSALEM, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military announced on Monday that five soldiers were killed and eight others severely injured in an explosion at a building in the northern Gaza Strip.
The cause of the explosion, which led to the collapse of the building, was not immediately clear, and the Israeli military said the incident was still under investigation.
In a statement, the military identified the victims as members of the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Nahal Brigade, including their 23-year-old squad commander. The soldiers "fell in battle" in Beit Hanoun, according to the statement.
The eight injured soldiers, from the same battalion, were "severely" wounded and evacuated to a hospital.
The deaths bring the total number of Israeli soldiers killed to 840 since the beginning of Israel's multi-front war in October 2023.
The incident occurred as Israeli and Hamas negotiators were advancing indirect talks in Qatar's Doha in an effort to reach a ceasefire deal after more than 15 months of deadly fighting. â–

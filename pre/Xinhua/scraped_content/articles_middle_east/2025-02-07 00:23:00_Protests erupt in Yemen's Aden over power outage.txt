ADEN, Yemen, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Widespread protests erupted Thursday in Yemen's Aden over persistent electricity interruption.
Protesters took to the streets in multiple districts, including Sheikh Othman, Mansourah, and Khormaksar, burning tires and blocking traffic to express their frustration.
The protesters denounced deteriorating public services and demanded immediate electricity restoration.
It came as the Aden Electricity Corporation announced Tuesday night a total shutdown of the city's electricity system due to fuel depletion at generating stations. The corporation warned that this complete system failure would critically impact vital sectors, including health facilities, water infrastructure, and commercial activities.
In a statement released by the state-run Saba news agency earlier on Thursday, Yemen's Prime Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak said he has directed government officials to implement emergency solutions to address the crisis.
He emphasized that the total electricity interruption was "unacceptable" and required a serious governmental response to determine and hold accountable those responsible for the systemic failure.
According to the statement, specific emergency measures include accelerating crude oil pumping from the Safer oil field to supply power stations in Aden with necessary fuel. However, the prime minister stressed that the government's ultimate goal is not immediate fuel provision but implementing comprehensive and sustainable reforms in the energy sector.
The power crisis has been a continuing challenge facing Aden, which has struggled with deteriorating basic services since 2015. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. technology giant Nvidia announced in a statement on Wednesday that it has launched a project of building a new research and engineering data center in northern Israel.
The statement did not disclose the amounts, but Israel's state-owned Kan TV News and other leading Israeli media outlets estimated the total investment in the project at more than half a billion U.S. dollars.
According to the statement, the new facility is expected to start operation in the first half of 2025 and will be among the largest, most powerful data center labs in Israel.
It will cover 10,000 square meters of next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure, with a power capacity of up to 30 megawatts.
The center will be powered by hundreds of Nvidia's liquid-cooled Blackwell systems alongside the company's other communication platforms and technologies.
It will be used by Nvidia's teams to develop next-generation data center technologies, including networking hardware, CPU design, AI software, and more.
Since its 2020 acquisition of the Israeli company Mellanox Technologies for about 6.9 billion U.S. dollars, Nvidia's employee base in the country has grown by more than double to over 4,000. â–

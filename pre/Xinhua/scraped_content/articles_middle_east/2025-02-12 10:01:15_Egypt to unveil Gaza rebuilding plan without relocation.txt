CAIRO, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt plans to present a comprehensive Gaza reconstruction plan designed to ensure Palestinians remain on their land, officials said Tuesday.
The Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement that the plan will be formulated in a way that respects and upholds the legitimate and legal rights of the Palestinian people.
According to the ministry, any proposed solution must consider the peace process within the region and seek to resolve the root causes of the ongoing conflict.
This requires an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the implementation of the two-state solution, which is the sole path towards achieving stability and peaceful coexistence among all peoples in the region, the statement added.
The statement also expressed Egypt's aspiration to cooperate with the United States to achieve "a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause that upholds the rights of the region's peoples." â–

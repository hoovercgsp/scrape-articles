JERUSALEM, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed a delegation to depart for Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to resume negotiations with mediating countries regarding the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire-hostage agreement with Hamas, according to multiple Israeli media outlets.
The delegation is reportedly not authorized to discuss the details of the second phase of the deal, focusing instead on completing the release of 33 Israeli hostages currently held by Hamas. To date, 15 hostages have been released in five exchanges.
In a video statement released on Saturday, Netanyahu, who is currently in the United States, reiterated his commitment to securing the release of all hostages, stating, "We will do everything to return all of our hostages. We will see to their safety. This is the directive that I gave to the delegation -- say this to the mediators and demand it."
Netanyahu also reaffirmed Israel's intention to "eliminate Hamas," adding that U.S. President Donald Trump "completely" supported this goal. â–

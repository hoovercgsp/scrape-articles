JERUSALEM, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed on Friday the death of 22-year-old Hamza Ziyadne, an Israeli-Bedouin hostage kidnapped by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack.
In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) said the body of Hamza was found alongside that of his father, 53-year-old Yussef Ziyadne, in an underground tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday during their joint operation.
The father's body was identified shortly after being brought to Israel, and his funeral was held on Thursday in the southern Bedouin city of Rahat.
In an announcement on Wednesday about the recovery of the father's body, the IDF noted evidence found during the recovery operation raised "serious concerns" about the fate of his son Hamza, who was also taken hostage. Hamza's body was later identified following the conclusion of forensic tests and police examination.
Ziyadne and his three children -- Hamza, Bilal, 18, and Aisha, 17 -- were kidnapped while working at Kibbutz Holit during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
Bilal and Aisha were freed during a hostage exchange in November 2023.
Of the 251 people abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, nearly 100 remain in Gaza, with at least 36 believed dead, according to Israeli officials. â–

DAMASCUS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel carried out airstrikes on military sites in the countryside of Syrian capital Damascus on Saturday, targeting facilities in the Deir Ali area, local media reported.
According to Sham FM, the attack struck a location near the capital, while the Israeli military claimed its aircraft had bombed a weapons depot belonging to Hamas in the same area. No casualties were immediately confirmed.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, reported that Israeli airstrikes hit storage facilities linked to the First Division and Brigade 166 in Al-Kiswah, southern Syria.
The strikes triggered powerful explosions, setting off fires at the targeted sites, though the number of casualties and the extent of damage remains unclear.
The attack is part of an ongoing pattern of Israeli airstrikes on military sites in Syria, often targeting weapons depots and positions associated with Iran-backed groups and Palestinian factions.
Israeli officials have repeatedly stated their commitment to preventing arms transfers to Hezbollah and other militant groups operating within Syrian territory.
There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities on the attack. â–

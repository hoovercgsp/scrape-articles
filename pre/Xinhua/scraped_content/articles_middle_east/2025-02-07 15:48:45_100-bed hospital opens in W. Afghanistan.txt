KABUL, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Afghan authorities have inaugurated a newly constructed 100-bed hospital in Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province in western Afghanistan, the official Bakhtar News Agency reported on Friday.
Built at a cost of 2 million U.S. dollars, the hospital aims to provide essential healthcare services to the residents of Nimroz, one of the country's least developed provinces.
As part of ongoing efforts to improve healthcare in post-war Afghanistan, the Ministry of Public Health has announced plans to establish 318 general hospitals across the country.
The Afghan caretaker government has reiterated its commitment to strengthening the healthcare system by expanding medical facilities and improving access to healthcare services nationwide. â–

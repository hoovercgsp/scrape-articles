AMMAN, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi on Sunday expressed his country's readiness to work immediately and effectively with the European Union (EU) to facilitate the entry of European aid into the Gaza Strip.
He made the remarks in a meeting in Amman with European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness, and Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib, the state-run Petra news agency reported.
During the meeting, Safadi and Lahbib discussed relations between Jordan and the EU and ways to develop them across various fields, in light of the two sides' intention to sign an agreement to elevate relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, paving the way for enhanced cooperation in multiple areas.
They also reviewed the developments in Gaza, including the delivery of sufficient and immediate aid, particularly after the implementation of a ceasefire, and the need to increase assistance to address the humanitarian disaster in the enclave.
Safadi stressed the importance of collective efforts to stabilize the ceasefire agreement and of a just and comprehensive solution that meets the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of their independent, sovereign state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the two-state solution.
The two sides also discussed developments in Syria and affirmed their coordination in providing humanitarian aid to Syria. They emphasized support for the Syrian people during this transitional phase to rebuild their country and institutions on foundations that ensure the country's security, stability, and sovereignty while safeguarding the rights of all its citizens.
For her part, in a post on the social media platform X, Lahbib said she had discussed regional challenges, access to Gaza, and Jordan as a logistical hub for (aid to) Syria during the meeting with Safadi. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli police said Friday in a statement that they, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), arrested four Palestinians who were filmed on social media wrapping themselves in Hamas flags.
As part of social media monitoring on Thursday evening, footage emerged of young men wrapped in Hamas flags and allegedly handing out sweets to passing vehicles in the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in East Jerusalem, the statement said.
Following the footage, intelligence and investigative operations were carried out by the ISA and the police, and within a short time, the four, residents of Shuafat, were located, it said.
A dummy gun and ammunition were seized during a search of their homes, it said, adding that the forces also uncovered and seized many Hamas flags in public spaces.
Israel captured East Jerusalem, along with the rest of the West Bank, in the 1967 Six-Day War. Under international law, East Jerusalem is considered occupied Palestinian territory, and its annexation by Israel is deemed illegal. â–

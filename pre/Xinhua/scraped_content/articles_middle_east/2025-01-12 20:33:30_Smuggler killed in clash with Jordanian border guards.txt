AMMAN, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army said on Sunday that the border guards clashed at dawn with armed smugglers attempting to cross the kingdom's northern border, resulting in the death of one smuggler.
After the clash, the remaining smugglers retreated into Syrian territory, the state-run Petra news agency reported.
The smugglers had attempted to cross the kingdom's international borders, taking advantage of unstable weather conditions and dense fog in the area, it added.
Large quantities of narcotics, two automatic weapons, and a handgun were seized, and the confiscated items were handed over to the relevant authorities, according to the report.
One border guard officer was injured during the clash and was airlifted to a medical facility, where he is reported to be in stable condition. â–

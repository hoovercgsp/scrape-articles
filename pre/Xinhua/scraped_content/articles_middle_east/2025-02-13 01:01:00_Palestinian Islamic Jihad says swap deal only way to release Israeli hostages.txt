GAZA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), said on Wednesday that a prisoner-for-hostage exchange deal is the only way to release the Israeli hostages and restore stability, holding Israel responsible for any possible escalation.
"The Palestinian factions have fulfilled their duties and obligations to the fullest extent, while Israel has left its prisoners in a state of danger and uncertainty," Abu Hamza, the military spokesperson for Al-Quds Brigades, said in a press statement.
He added that the Israeli government bears the consequences of its failure to fulfill its obligations towards the afflicted Palestinian people and the ongoing violations of the ceasefire agreement, stressing that the fate of Israeli prisoners held by the factions is linked to the behavior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"We emphasize the fixed rule that we are committed to the ceasefire agreement in all its aspects, as long as Israel has committed to it," he added.
These statements came amid escalating tensions over the implementation of the agreement.
On Monday, Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal that took effect on Jan. 19, including by blocking vital humanitarian aid.
The handover of the hostages will be postponed until Israel adheres to the deal and compensates retroactively for past violations, said Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.
In response, Netanyahu said on Tuesday that if the Israeli hostages held in Gaza were not returned by Saturday, the ceasefire with Hamas would be canceled, and Israel would resume "intensive fighting" in the war-torn enclave. â–

GAZA, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Hamas accused Israel on Tuesday of failing to uphold its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
In a statement, Hamas said, "Israel has not fulfilled its commitments and bears full responsibility for any complications or delays."
The movement reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire as long as Israel abides by it, emphasizing that the agreement was brokered and guaranteed by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, with international oversight.
Hamas' armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, announced on Monday that the planned release of Israeli captives set for Saturday would be postponed indefinitely due to what it described as Israel's failure to uphold the ceasefire terms.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that if the Israeli hostages held in Gaza were not returned by Saturday, the ceasefire with Hamas will be canceled, and Israel will resume "intensive fighting" in the war-torn enclave.
Under the current ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19 after 15 months of war, 21 hostages -- 16 Israelis and five Thais -- have been released from Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees freed from Israeli jails.
During the first phase of the agreement, which spans six weeks, 33 Israeli hostages and about 2,000 Palestinian detainees are expected to be released. â–

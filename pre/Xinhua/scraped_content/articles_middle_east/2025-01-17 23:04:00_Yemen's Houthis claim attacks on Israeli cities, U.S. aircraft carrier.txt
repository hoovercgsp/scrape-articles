SANAA, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group said on Friday that it launched multiple rocket and drone attacks at three Israeli cities and also conducted a fresh attack against U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea.
"In response to the recent massacres against our brothers in Gaza, we carried out a military operation targeting vital targets in the Israeli southern port city of Eilat, using four cruise missiles," Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.
He added that his group also targeted other vital targets in the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Ashkelon and launched the 7th attack against the U.S. aircraft carrier in the northern Red Sea since its arrival. â–

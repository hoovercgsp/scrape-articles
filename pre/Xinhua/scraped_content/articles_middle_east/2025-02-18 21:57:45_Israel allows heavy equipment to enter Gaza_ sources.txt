GAZA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli authorities on Tuesday allowed the entry of heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, according to Palestinian sources.
Speaking to Xinhua, the anonymous sources in Gaza said the flow of the equipment, including bulldozers, excavators, and transport trucks, was permitted after prolonged negotiations. Israel had initially obstructed the equipment's entry, citing concerns that the equipment could be used for military purposes.
For its part, Hamas has insisted that it is strictly intended for clearing debris and rehabilitating infrastructure damaged by recent Israeli strikes.
Israel has imposed stringent restrictions on the entry of heavy machinery into Gaza during the war. â–

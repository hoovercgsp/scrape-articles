BAGHDAD, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Four Islamic State (IS) militants were killed in an air strike in eastern Iraq's Diyala province, the Iraqi military said on Saturday.
Acting on intelligence, Iraqi forces conducted the air strike on Friday targeting an IS hideout in the Hamrin mountains, north of Diyala, the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command, said in a statement.
A joint force of army and intelligence personnel searched the targeted area on Saturday morning, finding the bodies of four militants, including a leader who will be identified later, the statement added.
Weapons, explosive belts, hand grenades, and logistical supplies were also found at the hideout.
While Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, remnants of the group continue to carry out attacks against security forces and civilians in urban areas, deserts, and remote regions. â–

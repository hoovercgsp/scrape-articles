BEIRUT, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the European Union has approved a 60-million-euro (about 62.6 mln USD) assistance package under the European Peace Facility (EPF) to support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), the EU's delegation to Lebanon announced Wednesday.
The EU delegation's statement noted that the assistance would contribute to strengthening the LAF's capacities, enabling them to redeploy, secure, and maintain stability in the South of the Litani Sector of the country in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1701.
It said the assistance measure will also enhance the LAF's operational capabilities and effectiveness to contribute to national and regional security and stability, thereby allowing displaced civilians on both sides to return to their homes.
"This new assistance marks a significant uptake in the EU's support to the Lebanese Armed Forces under the European Peace Facility at a critical juncture for the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel," said Kaja Kallas, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. â–

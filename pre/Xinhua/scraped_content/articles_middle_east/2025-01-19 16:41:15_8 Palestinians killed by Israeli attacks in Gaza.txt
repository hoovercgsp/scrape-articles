GAZA, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- At least eight Palestinians were killed by Israeli army attacks in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, a Palestinian official said.
In a press statement, Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense, said that five Palestinians were killed by the Israeli attacks in Gaza city and three others were killed in north Gaza.
Local security sources and eye-witnesses told Xinhua that the Israeli tanks and warplanes are still attacking northern and central Gaza.
However, Israel said the ceasefire will not take effect in Gaza unless it receives a list of the hostages to be released.
Earlier on Sunday, Hamas issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to the deal, claiming the delay in delivering the names of the first three hostages was "due to technical reasons and reasons on the ground." â–

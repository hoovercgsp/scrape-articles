ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group has said it will restrict maritime attacks only to Israel-linked vessels, contingent upon the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, according to the Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center (HOCC).
In a shift from their previous stance, the Sanaa-based HOCC, which serves as an intermediary between Houthis and commercial shipping operators, declared the suspension of "sanctions" against vessels owned by U.S. or British entities or those sailing under their flags.
"We affirm that, in the event of any aggression against the Republic of Yemen by the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or the usurping Israeli entity, the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor," HOCC said in an email communication to shipping industry officials dated Sunday, where it maintained a cautionary tone.
It said the Houthis would stop targeting Israel-linked ships "upon the full implementation of all phases of" the Gaza ceasefire deal, which was reached on Wednesday through the mediation of Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, and took effect on Sunday.
The development came amid significant disruption to global maritime commerce, as major shipping companies have opted to reroute their vessels around the southern tip of Africa, abandoning the vital Red Sea route due to security concerns.
The Houthis have been launching missile and drone attacks targeting what it called "Israel-linked" ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November 2023 to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
In response, the U.S.-British naval coalition stationed in the waters has since January 2024 conducted regular air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, prompting the Houthis to expand attacks to include U.S. warships. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Three rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel on Monday, with one striking a home in the city of Sderot, Israeli sources said.
The Israeli military said in a statement that the rockets were launched from northern Gaza. One of the rockets was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force, another landed in Sderot, and the third fell in a nearby open area.
No injuries were reported, but the Sderot municipality confirmed that one rocket hit the backyard of a residential home. Photos circulating on social media showed minor damage at the site.
Rocket fire from Gaza has intensified recently, as the Israeli military has ramped up airstrikes and ground raids on the enclave amid revived negotiations in Qatar's Doha aimed at halting a 15-month conflict between Israel and Hamas.
According to the latest tally by health authorities in Gaza, Israeli strikes have killed 45,854 Palestinians and injured 109,139 others in the enclave. â–

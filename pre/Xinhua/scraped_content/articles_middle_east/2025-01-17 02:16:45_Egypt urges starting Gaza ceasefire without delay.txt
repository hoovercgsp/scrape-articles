CAIRO, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt stressed the importance of starting without delay the implementation of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip and the exchange of hostages and prisoners, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
The statement reiterated the necessity of deal parties to adhere to its provisions and implement its phases within the specified timeframe.
Enforcing the agreement will speed up the safe and effective distribution of humanitarian aid on a broad scale throughout the besieged enclave, the statement said.
It also called on the international community to back humanitarian efforts, to start early recovery projects in preparation for the reconstruction of the war-torn areas, with Egypt's readiness to host an international conference in this regard.
The statement stressed the Gaza ceasefire deal, which was reached with strenuous efforts of Egypt, Qatar and the United States, contributes to stopping the bloodshed of the innocent Palestinian people, who suffered from the scourge of war and humanitarian crisis for more than 15 months.
The deal also marks the beginning of a serious and credible political process leading to the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, the statement added.
On Thursday, a day after Israel agreed to a ceasefire deal with Hamas, Israel's military said it struck about 50 sites across the Gaza Strip. â–

JERUSALEM, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) announced on Wednesday a new investment of 100 million shekels (27.88 million U.S. dollars) to support cutting-edge research in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and intelligent integrated sensing and communication (IISAC).
Over the next three years, the investment will focus on SAF research, developed in collaboration with Boeing, and the IISAC initiative, a project that combines positioning, sensing, and communication into a unified smart network.
These efforts will help create cost-effective, bio-based jet fuel from renewable sources and next-generation telecom technologies that improve real-time situational awareness, ultra-fast response times, and network efficiency for future 5G and 6G applications.
The IIA noted that the funding aims to position Israel as a global leader in deep-tech innovation, strengthen key industries, and open up new market opportunities worldwide.
The initiative will bring together top Israeli companies, academic institutions, and global partners to develop advanced sustainable aviation technologies and next-generation communication networks. â–

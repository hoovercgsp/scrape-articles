TEHRAN, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, on Thursday exchanged views on a ceasefire agreement reached between Hamas and Israel to end the 15-months-long conflict in Gaza.
The Iranian foreign minister expressed satisfaction with the truce agreement reached on Wednesday, saying it was the result of the "steadfastness and perseverance" of the Palestinian resistance and the resistant people of Gaza in the face of 15 months of "genocide" by Israel, according to a statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
He praised Qatar for its efforts towards the achievement of the agreement, calling on the international community to pay attention to improving the Palestinian people's lives and situation in the Gaza Strip, as well as the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Gazans.
The Qatari prime minister and foreign minister, for his part, presented a report of the negotiations process that led to the achievement of the ceasefire agreement, commending Iran for its principled positions of supporting the Palestinian people, especially during the past 15 months.
Israel and Hamas have agreed on a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The agreement includes an initial 42-day phase, during which more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt, and 33 hostages held in Gaza will be released. â–

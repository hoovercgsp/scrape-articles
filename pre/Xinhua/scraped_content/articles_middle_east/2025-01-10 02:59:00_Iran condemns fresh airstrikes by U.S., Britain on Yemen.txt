TEHRAN, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei on Thursday strongly condemned new airstrikes by the United States and Britain against infrastructure targets in Yemen.
He made the remarks in a statement by the ministry after the U.S.-British coalition launched airstrikes on several targets inside the three Yemeni provinces of Sanaa, Amran, and Hodeidah on Thursday before dawn.
Baghaei stressed that such "criminal" actions would fail to affect the Yemeni people's determination to express support for and solidarity with the "oppressed" Palestinians.
He said the frequent "aggressions" by the United States and Britain against Yemen's infrastructure were in "flagrant violation" of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter, calling on the international community, especially Muslim and regional countries, to take serious actions to stop the "occupation, genocide and aggression" by Israel and its supporters against peoples in West Asia.
The Houthi group has been launching rocket and drone attacks against Israel and disrupting "Israeli-linked" shipping in the Red Sea since November 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians amid their conflict with Israel in the Gaza Strip.
In response, the U.S.-led naval coalition stationed in the area has been conducting regular air raids and strikes on Houthi targets to deter the group, prompting the Houthis to expand attacks to include U.S. warships. â–

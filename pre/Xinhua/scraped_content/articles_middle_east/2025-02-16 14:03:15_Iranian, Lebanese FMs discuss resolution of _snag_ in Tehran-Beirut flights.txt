TEHRAN, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi and his Lebanese counterpart, Youssef Rajji, on Saturday discussed how to resolve the "snag" in civil aviation between the two countries.
In a phone call, the two sides discussed bilateral relations as well as the latest developments in the West Asia region, according to a statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
The two foreign ministers expressed their readiness to hold "constructive talks based on goodwill," the statement said, adding they also highlighted the necessity to expand bilateral relations in different areas in line with the two nations' interests and on the basis of mutual respect.
Araghchi congratulated Rajji on his appointment as Lebanon's new foreign minister and wished him and the new Lebanese government success.
Lebanese aviation authorities on Thursday barred an Iranian passenger flight from landing at Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport, following an Israeli claim that Iran had been using the airport to "smuggle funds to Hezbollah."
On the same day, Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had "temporarily rescheduled" some flights, including from Iran, until Feb. 18 as additional security measures were being implemented.
Iran's Civil Aviation Organization confirmed in a statement on Friday that the Lebanese aviation authorities had canceled the permits for flights by Iran's Mahan Air to Beirut on Feb. 13 and 14, and by Iran Air, the country's national carrier, on Feb. 18.
Later in the day, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei condemned Israel's "threat against the civilian plane carrying Lebanese citizens" from Tehran to Beirut, saying the move disrupted normal flights and was a continuation of Israel's "flagrant and constant violations" of international principles and regulations. â–

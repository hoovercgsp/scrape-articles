BAGHDAD, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service said Thursday that its forces killed up to 70 Islamic State (IS) militants in 2024.
In a statement, the Service said that its forces conducted 344 operations across the country during the year and arrested 144 terrorists, in addition to destroying 310 IS hideouts.
One of the most prominent operations of the Service during the year was the killing of the commander of the IS group for Iraq and eight other senior IS leaders in their hideouts in the Hamrin mountain range, it added.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

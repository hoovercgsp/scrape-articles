JERUSALEM, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- French flag carrier Air France resumed its flights to Israel on Saturday after a suspension of over four months.
The operations resumed with a flight that took off from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and landed Saturday afternoon at Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv.
Air France will now operate one daily flight on the route, compared to two daily flights before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October 2023.
Meanwhile, Dutch low-cost carrier Transavia Airlines, part of the Air France-KLM group, is expected to resume flights from Paris to Tel Aviv on Tuesday.
In addition, the Lufthansa Group recently announced that it will resume flights to Israel on February 1 after a hiatus of over four months.
Following the outbreak of Israel's multi-front conflict, most foreign airlines suspended their flights to Israel, returning intermittently to partial operations depending on the intensity of the fighting. â–

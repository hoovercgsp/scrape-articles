DOHA, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Majed Al Ansari confirmed on Sunday that the Gaza ceasefire has officially begun as a list of three hostages to be released that day has been handed over to Israel.
"Regarding reports when the ceasefire will begin in Gaza, we confirm that the names of the 3 hostages to be released today have been handed over to the Israeli side. They are three Israeli citizens, one of whom is of Romanian nationality and the other of British nationality, and thus the ceasefire has begun," Al-Ansari said in a post on X.
A day earlier, Al-Ansari announced that the Gaza ceasefire would commence on Sunday, Jan. 19, at 8:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT) in Gaza.
Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed on a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. â–

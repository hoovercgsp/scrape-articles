BEIRUT, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli airstrike targeted a vehicle Monday morning at the northern entrance of the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon, killing one person.
According to the official National News Agency, firefighting teams have extinguished the flames engulfing the vehicle and retrieved the body of the killed person from the targeted car.
The Al Hadath TV channel said on the X Platform that the target of the airstrike was Mohamad Chahine, a military official from Hamas.
A ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and the Israeli military has been in effect since Nov. 27, 2024, halting over a year of clashes triggered by the Gaza war.
The agreement requires Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory within 60 days while the Lebanese army assumes control along the border and in the south, ensuring no presence of weapons or armed groups south of the Litani River.
On Jan. 27, Lebanon's caretaker government announced an extension of the ceasefire agreement until Feb. 18, following the expiration of the initial 60-day period without a complete Israeli withdrawal.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have continued to conduct strikes in Lebanon, citing security threats. â–

GAZA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of sick and wounded Palestinians headed to the Rafah crossing on Saturday to leave the Gaza Strip for treatment abroad, the first of its kind in eight months, according to Palestinian sources.
They arrived at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis in southern Gaza before being transported by buses to the border crossing.
The list of 50 people scheduled to leave Gaza, including the sick, wounded, and their companions, was delivered to the relevant authorities on Friday, Mohammed Zaqout, director general of hospitals in Gaza, told Xinhua.
Representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO) have been at the hospitals to receive these patients, Zaqout added.
The Hebrew public radio reported Saturday that the Israeli army withdrew from the Rafah crossing and handed it over to international forces on Friday, adding the Israeli side has approved the list of Palestinians slated to leave through the crossing.
The hospitals and health centers in Gaza are facing great difficulties, including a lack of medical supplies and destruction of their facilities, due to 15 months of brutal war between Israel and Hamas.
The WHO called for resuming urgent medical evacuation from Gaza as up to 15,000 people currently need treatment outside the strip. â–

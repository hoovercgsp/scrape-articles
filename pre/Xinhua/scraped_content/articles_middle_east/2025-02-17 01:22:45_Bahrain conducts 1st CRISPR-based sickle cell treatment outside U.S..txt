MANAMA, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain has achieved a medical milestone by successfully treating a patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) using CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy, Casgevy, the Bahrain Oncology Center said on Sunday.
It marks the first successful treatment of its kind outside the United States, according to the institution.
Casgevy, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, is the world's first licensed therapy to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, for which its discoverers were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
The therapy offers a potential functional cure for SCD and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT)-inherited blood disorders that significantly impact health and life expectancy.
"This milestone exemplifies Bahrain's commitment to integrating global medical innovations into the national healthcare strategy," said Health Minister Jaleela bint Al Sayed Jawad Hasan.
"By fostering partnerships across institutions, we are delivering on our mandate to provide access to life-changing therapies for all beneficiaries and positioning Bahrain as a hub for innovative medical care," noted the minister.
In 2023, Bahrain became the second country globally, following Britain, and the first in the Middle East to approve Casgevy for treating SCD and TDT.
The treatment involves a multi-stage process including stimulating the patient's bone marrow to produce large quantities of stem cells, editing the cells to produce red blood cells carrying functional hemoglobin, and transplanting the edited cells back into the patient's bloodstream after safety testing.
"This provides renewed hope for patients with complex blood disorders and reinforces the kingdom's growing focus on healthcare innovation," said Commander of Royal Medical Services Shaikh Fahad bin Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa.
Edward Rowland, CEO of the Bahrain Oncology Center, described the development as a reflection of the institution's focus on advanced technology and global partnerships, adding that the clinical team is honored to bring CRISPR-based therapy to patients in Bahrain and beyond. â–

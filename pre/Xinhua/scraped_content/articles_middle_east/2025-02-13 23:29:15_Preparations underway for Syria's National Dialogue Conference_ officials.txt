DAMASCUS, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for Syria's National Dialogue Conference have officially begun, with organizers on Thursday emphasizing its inclusivity for all Syrians.
During a press conference in Damascus on Thursday, members of the preparatory committee of the conference stressed that the conference will ensure all perspectives are heard as the country seeks to build a stable and democratic state.
Huda Al-Atassi, a member of the preparatory committee, called the event a historic opportunity to shape Syria's future through an inclusive and responsible dialogue.
"The conference is committed to including all segments of the Syrian people, from various provinces and communities, to ensure genuine participation that reflects the country's social and political diversity," Al-Atassi said.
According to Al-Atassi, the goal of the conference is to create a comprehensive dialogue that transcends past divisions and fosters national unity.
Conference spokesperson Hassan Al-Daghim emphasized that participation will not be determined by religious or political affiliation but by national identity.
"Without a doubt, no one will be invited to the conference based on their religion, affiliation, institution, or party. Every Syrian will be invited simply for being a Syrian patriot, as sectarian and ethnic quotas have no place in the national dialogue agenda," he stated.
"What matters is competence, technocratic expertise, love for the homeland, and the preservation of Syria's unity in both land and people. Every patriotic Syrian represents their fellow citizens," Al-Daghim added.
The Syrian interim government has yet to confirm a date for the event.
The Syrian interim government announced Wednesday the establishment of a preparatory committee for the National Dialogue Conference. The committee is responsible for establishing the framework of the conference to ensure a successful dialogue. â–

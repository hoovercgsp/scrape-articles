TEHRAN, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian left Tehran on Wednesday for visits to Tajikistan and Russia, aiming to strengthen ties with both nations.
The visit is part of his administration's broader effort to promote ties with neighboring and regional countries, in line with policies set by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to a statement from his office.
Before departing for Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, Pezeshkian said the trip aligns with Iran's goals to enhance cooperation with Tajikistan in various sectors. During his visit to Russia, the two countries are expected to sign a comprehensive strategic cooperation agreement, covering areas such as economy, science, industry, agriculture, culture, and security.
The Kremlin announced on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet with Pezeshkian in Moscow on Friday to sign a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. â–

CAIRO, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said on Wednesday that Cairo is committed to working on the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement recently reached between Israel and Hamas.
"We are absolutely committed to working diligently toward the full implementation of this agreement to end the bloodshed of our Palestinian brothers and sisters and restore essential services to the Gaza Strip to make it habitable," Sisi said in a televised speech marking the 73rd anniversary of the Egyptian Police Day.
He stressed Egypt's categorical rejection of "any attempts" to displace the Palestinian people outside their lands.
Israel and Hamas reached a three-stage ceasefire deal last week, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, after more than 15 months of fighting.
The current six-week stage of the truce deal, which began on Sunday, includes the release of Israeli captives from Gaza and Palestinians from Israeli prisons, as well as intensified humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza and partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave. â–

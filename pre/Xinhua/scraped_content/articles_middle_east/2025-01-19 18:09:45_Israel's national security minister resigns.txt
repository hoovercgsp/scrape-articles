JERUSALEM, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his party submitted their resignation to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government on Sunday, citing opposition to the Gaza ceasefire deal.
The move leaves Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority in parliament.
In his resignation letter, Ben-Gvir described the ceasefire as "dangerous" and "a surrender deal to terrorism."
Ben-Gvir said that he opposes halting the war, withdrawing forces, and releasing Palestinian prisoners convicted of attacks against Israelis. He also opposes another term of the deal, under which Israel agrees to allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza.
However, he said that his party might return to the government if the war is resumed.
The move leaves Netanyahu's coalition with a thin majority of 62 members in the 120-member parliament. If far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich leaves, Netanyahu will lose his majority, potentially triggering new elections. â–

BEIRUT, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Salameh has spent nearly his entire life on the slopes. At 31, he has been skiing for 27 years, starting at three. For him, skiing is more than a sport; it's a way of life. The rush, the challenge, and the communion with nature define his identity.
But lately, Lebanon's ski seasons have been shrinking, leaving Salameh and other skiers longing for the golden days of December snowfall and bustling resorts.
"This has been happening for three to four years," Salameh said. "The season keeps getting delayed, and it's depressing for us skiers."
With snowfall arriving late and melting early, he now travels to Sweden to extend his ski season.
The ski season in Lebanon typically begins in mid-December, but this year, it officially started on January 3, two weeks ahead of last year. However, the lack of sufficient snowfall at lower altitudes meant that only 70 percent of the slopes at Mzaar Ski Resort in Kfardebian could open. The situation improved slightly with fresh snow in February, but the damage had already been done.
"We should have started in December," said Walid Beaino, head of the media department at the Kfardebian municipality. "The season has been delayed for the past four to five years. Now we're in February, and we've barely begun."
Beaino noted that the snow season is short this year and ends around March. "By the end of March, people's mood shifts to the beach season, even if there is snow," he said.
Ski instructor Zeid Bteich echoed the sentiment, emphasizing that early-season snow is crucial. "The snow that falls in December and January usually lasts," he explained. "But the snow in February and March melts quickly because the earth's temperature rises."
One of the biggest hits to the ski industry has been the absence of international visitors, especially from the Gulf.
Salameh runs a ski equipment shop and usually works with tourists from Egypt and Qatar, but this year, he hasn't had any customers. The war and Lebanon's economic crisis have kept foreign visitors away, compounding the challenges of an already difficult season.
Meanwhile, Nicole Wakim, head of the media department at the Intercontinental Mzaar Hotel in Kfardebian, told Xinhua that Lebanon's ski industry has long relied on foreign tourists, particularly visitors from the Gulf, who book hotels, dine in restaurants, rent ski equipment, and hire instructors. However, tourism has dwindled in recent years due to political instability, economic hardship, and regional conflicts.
"In previous years, expatriates and tourists would come, especially from Arab countries," she said. "This year, they are absent. Instead of 5,000 skiers on the slopes, we now have only about 1,000."
Hotels, restaurants, and ski resorts have all suffered. While some have managed to stay afloat by shifting their focus to local visitors, the financial losses are significant.
"Our tourist area relies on skiing," said Freddy Keirouz, head of the municipality of Bcharre, home to the famous Cedars ski resort. "Without snow, businesses suffer. The losses are huge, and they won't be compensated."
Despite the difficult start, there is some optimism. The recent snowfall in early February has brought skiers back to the mountains. Resorts and municipalities are hoping for a strong end to the season, similar to last year when February and March helped mitigate earlier losses.
"We may see improvement as it snows again in the coming days," Beaino said. "Last year, February and March compensated somewhat for the late start."
Still, professionals like Salameh know that the short season cannot fully compensate for lost time and revenue. "When you get into skiing, you can't stop," he said. "We just have to make the most of what we have."
As Lebanon grapples with political uncertainty and climate challenges, the future of its ski industry remains uncertain.
"We can't fabricate snow like in other countries," Keirouz said. "It's all in God's hands." â–

BEIRUT, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and two others wounded on Friday by explosives inside a house in Tayr Harfa village, southern Lebanon, state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported.
The house had been rigged with explosives by the Israeli army, according to the NNA.
In a separate incident, NNA reported a loud explosion in Bayssariyeh village in southern Lebanon, and later confirmed it as an Israeli airstrike near the village.
The agency also said the Israeli army was demolishing homes in Kafr Kila village in southern Lebanon.
These incidents occurred despite a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, which has been in effect since Nov. 27, 2024, halting over a year of clashes triggered by the Gaza war. â–

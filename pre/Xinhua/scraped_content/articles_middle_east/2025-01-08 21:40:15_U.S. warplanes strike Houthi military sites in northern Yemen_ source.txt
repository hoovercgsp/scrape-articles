ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes carried out seven airstrikes on military sites held by the Houthi group in northern Yemen on Wednesday, a military official of the Yemeni government forces told Xinhua.
The official said on condition of anonymity that the strikes targeted key military locations in the Harf Sufyan district of Amran province and Jarban area in Sanhan district, south of the Yemeni capital Sanaa, the official said.
He provided no details regarding casualties or the scale of damage caused by the airstrikes.
According to the source, some of the targeted sites are believed to be underground weapons storage facilities used by the Houthi group.
Meanwhile, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed the strikes in a statement posted on X, saying, "CENTCOM forces conducted multiple precision strikes against two Iranian-backed Houthi underground Advanced Conventional Weapon (ACW) storage facilities within Houthi-controlled territories of Yemen, Jan. 8."
The statement added that the Houthi group used these facilities to carry out attacks on U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
There has been no immediate comment from the Houthi group regarding the strikes.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have been carrying out rocket and drone attacks on Israeli cities and disrupting "Israeli-linked" shipping in the Red Sea.
In response, the U.S.-led navy coalition stationed in the area has been conducting regular air raids on Houthi targets since January 2024 in a bid to deter the armed group. â–

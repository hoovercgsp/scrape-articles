DAMASCUS, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian authorities on Tuesday released seven members of its security forces taken hostage by an armed group in northwestern Latakia province, according to officials and war monitors.
Mustafa Knaifati, head of general security in Latakia, told the state-run SANA news agency that his forces, in cooperation with the Military Operations Administration, "successfully freed our personnel."
"We will not tolerate these criminals. We will secure our civilian population and cleanse Syria of them," he added, noting that the person who led the abduction had detonated himself while other members of the militia were taken into custody.
The militants in the town of Ain al-Sharqiyah reportedly captured the seven security personnel late Monday. In a video, the kidnappers threatened to kill the hostages unless authorities halted plans to enter Ain al-Sharqiyah.
The reported standoff occurred amid broader campaigns in Homs, Damascus, and Latakia provinces by the transitional authorities seeking to consolidate control following the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. â–

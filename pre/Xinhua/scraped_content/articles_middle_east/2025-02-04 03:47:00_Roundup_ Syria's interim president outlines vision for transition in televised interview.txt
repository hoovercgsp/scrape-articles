DAMASCUS, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, in his first televised interview since assuming office, detailed the strategy behind the fall of the Assad regime, his administration's priorities, and Syria's path toward democratic governance.
Speaking to Syria TV in a pre-recorded interview on Monday, al-Sharaa revealed that the swift collapse of the former government was the result of a five-year plan initiated in Idlib in northwestern Syria.
"The battle to bring down Assad's regime in 11 days was not spontaneous. It was the outcome of meticulous planning that began in Idlib, where we worked to unify factions and include all political forces," al-Sharaa said.
He acknowledged that the former regime had intelligence about the opposition's preparations and had mobilized its resources in response.
Some allies had even warned him against launching the final assault, fearing a prolonged urban conflict similar to Gaza. However, he asserted, "We decided to proceed."
Al-Sharaa underscored that toppling Bashar al-Assad was only the first step toward national renewal, emphasizing Syria's wealth of human capital and resources as key to its recovery.
"Idlib was home to Syrians from all provinces, and we ensured everyone was represented in the Salvation Government. When we entered Damascus, our priority was to safeguard state institutions," he said.
On political organization, he acknowledged the absence of a comprehensive legal framework for political parties but stressed that competence, rather than factionalism, would define government appointments.
"I am working to prevent Syria from falling into a sectarian quota system. Merit will be the standard for public office," he said.
Al-Sharaa credited the disciplined entry of opposition forces into major cities for preventing large-scale violence, adding that Syria has now reached a stage of relative stability.
"We have ensured public order, and the state remains a guarantor for all communities. Individual incidents are minimal," he said.
He dismissed concerns over territorial divisions, affirming that "everyone supports Syria's unity and rejects any partition or separation."
He also confirmed ongoing negotiations with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to resolve issues in the country's northeast.
Earlier in the day, a deadly car bombing struck the northern city of Manbij, killing at least 20. The region has witnessed intense clashes between Turkish-backed factions and the SDF, which have resulted in nearly 600 deaths since December, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.
Al-Sharaa also accused the former regime of turning Syria into a global hub for the illicit drug trade, particularly captagon, and vowed to dismantle the remnants of its operations.
On foreign policy, al-Sharaa emphasized that Syria's diplomatic outreach serves the interests of its people and aims to restore the country's standing in the Arab world and beyond.
He dismissed speculation that Syria would remain under one-man rule, promising expanded political freedoms under the rule of law.
To lay the groundwork for the transition, he announced the formation of a preparatory committee for a national conference, which will culminate in a constitutional declaration.
Al-Sharaa estimated that presidential elections could take place within four to five years. He also emphasized the delicate balance between transitional justice and national reconciliation, vowing to prosecute major crimes while ensuring stability.
"There is a fine line between transitional justice and social peace. We will pursue those who committed crimes against the Syrian people -- especially the key figures responsible," he said. â–

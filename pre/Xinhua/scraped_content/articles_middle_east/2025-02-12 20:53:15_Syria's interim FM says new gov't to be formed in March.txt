DAMASCUS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim Foreign Minister Asaad Al-Shaibani said Wednesday that a new Syrian government will be formed in March, according to the state news agency SANA.
The new government will represent "all segments of the Syrian population," Al-Shaibani told Kuwaiti journalist Ammar Taqi from Al-Qabas newspaper on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai, SANA reported.
"All Syrians played a role in this change. We understand the concerns that come with any transformation, and we are working to instill confidence among our people," he said, adding that a new constitution will serve as the guiding framework for all citizens.
Al-Shaibani urged the international community to support Syria's new leadership by advocating for the removal of Western sanctions. "Every economic expert understands the crisis we are facing."
Rebuilding the state and the military will take time, but initial progress has been made, he noted. "Markets have reopened, universities resumed operations, and employees returned to work."
"In a year, Syria will have redefined itself to the world. And in five years, we will be here talking about the progress we have achieved," he said.
Al-Shaibani said that Syria's ties with neighboring Jordan have become "stronger," and that he will soon visit Baghdad for diplomatic talks at the invitation of the Iraqi side.
Also on Wednesday, Syria's Defense Ministry forces held a military parade in Aleppo to showcase their "combat readiness and commitment to maintaining security across the country," according to a report by state-run Al-Thawra newspaper. â–

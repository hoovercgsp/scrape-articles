BEIRUT, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- With Israel's 60-day deadline to withdraw from Lebanese territory nearing its end, Hezbollah warned on Thursday against any delays, demanding full compliance with the ceasefire agreement.
In a statement, the group stressed the withdrawal must be completed without exception.
Addressing reports Israel might seek to extend its presence in Lebanon, Hezbollah urged the Lebanese government to press the agreement's sponsors to ensure the deadline is met. It called for close monitoring of the final phase of the pullout, the full deployment of the Lebanese army, and the swift return of displaced residents. The group also cautioned against allowing any pretexts to prolong the occupation.
Hezbollah emphasized that missing the deadline would constitute a clear violation of the agreement and an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty. It warned such a move would signal a new phase of occupation, requiring a firm response from the Lebanese state using all measures permitted under international law.
"As we closely follow the situation, which should culminate in a full withdrawal in the coming days, we stress that any breach of the agreement or attempt to evade commitments under false pretexts will be unacceptable," the statement said. "We call for strict adherence to the agreement, leaving no room for concessions." â–

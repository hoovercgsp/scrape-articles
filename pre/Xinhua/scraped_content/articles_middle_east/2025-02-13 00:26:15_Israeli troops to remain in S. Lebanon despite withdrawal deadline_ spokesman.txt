JERUSALEM, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon despite an approaching deadline for their withdrawal, an Israeli military spokesman said Wednesday, warning civilians against returning to the area.
"The IDF remains deployed in the area. Therefore, movement southward is prohibited," Avichai Adraee, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, wrote on social media platform X.
"For your safety, you are forbidden from returning to your homes in the affected areas until further notice," he warned. "Anyone moving south is putting themselves in danger."
Adraee said the implementation period of the ceasefire agreement "has been extended" but did not specify by whom or provide evidence of an extension.
Under a ceasefire deal reached in November last year between Israel and Lebanon, Israeli troops were required to withdraw from southern Lebanon by Jan. 26. The deadline was later extended to Feb. 18, and according to Lebanese reports, Israel has since requested a further extension through the committee overseeing the ceasefire.
There were conflicting reports about Israel's attempt to extend its troops' deployment at five positions in southern Lebanon until Feb. 28.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International reported that Lebanon had rejected Israel's request to keep its forces beyond the deadline. However, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news, citing unnamed Israeli Security Cabinet officials, claimed the United States had approved the request for "several posts" in southern Lebanon. The officials said the issue was among those discussed during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump last week in Washington. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expects that the release of three Israeli hostages planned for Saturday morning will take place at two locations in the Gaza Strip, Israel's state-owned Kan TV News reported on Friday.
The list of the three people intended for release, sent to Israel on Friday, includes 54-year-old Israeli-French citizen Ofer Calderon, 65-year-old Israeli-American citizen Keith Siegel, and 35-year-old Israeli civilian Yarden Bibas.
According to the channel, Siegel is expected to be handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross in Gaza City, while the other two hostages will be released in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
After being transferred to the Israeli military, the three hostages are scheduled to go to the IDF's Reim base near the Gaza border, where they will meet with family members before being flown by helicopters to hospitals in central Israel. â–

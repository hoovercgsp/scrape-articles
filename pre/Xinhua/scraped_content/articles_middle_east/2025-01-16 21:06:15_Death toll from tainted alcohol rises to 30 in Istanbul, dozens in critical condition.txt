ISTANBUL, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from bootleg alcohol in Istanbul has reached 30, local media reported on Thursday, sparking a crackdown on illicit production and sales.
The NTV reported that 30 people, including foreign nationals, died in the past 72 hours after consuming counterfeit alcohol, while 49 others remain hospitalized, 31 in critical condition.
The Istanbul Governor's Office announced raids at multiple sites, detaining six suspects linked to large-scale counterfeit alcohol distribution. Two were charged with intentional homicide and imprisoned, while legal proceedings continue for the others.
Authorities compared those involved in the counterfeit trade to "terrorists who kill people" and confirmed the seizure of 29 tonnes of illicit alcohol and the closure of 64 illegal businesses this year.
In a related move, the Turkish government tightened regulations on alcohol storage on Thursday, requiring official approval for storage facilities and banning shared or improperly located warehouses.
The governorate reported 110 hospitalizations and 48 deaths in 2024 from tainted alcohol. â–

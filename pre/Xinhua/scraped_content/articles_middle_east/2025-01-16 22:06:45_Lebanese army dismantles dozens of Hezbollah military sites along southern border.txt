BEIRUT, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army has worked to dismantle dozens of Hezbollah military sites and facilities on Thursday and confiscated the weapons inside them, a Lebanese security source told Xinhua.
"These weapons are being collected at one of the border points located in the western sector of southern Lebanon," the source added, noting they were "in preparation for destruction under the supervision of the five-member committee supervising the ceasefire agreement."
The source said the army, in coordination with the United Nations forces operating in southern Lebanon, has intensified its inspection for Hezbollah military sites south of the Litani River until the area is cleared of weapons and militants.
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, bringing an end to the confrontations that erupted between the two sides on Oct. 8, 2023.
The agreement stipulates that Israel withdraw from Lebanese territory within 60 days, with the Lebanese army deploying along the Lebanese-Israeli border and in the southern region, assuming security responsibilities and preventing any presence of weapons or militants in the area.
However, despite the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli army still carries out strikes in Lebanon, some of which resulted in deaths and injuries. Israel also accuses Hezbollah of ceasefire violations. â–

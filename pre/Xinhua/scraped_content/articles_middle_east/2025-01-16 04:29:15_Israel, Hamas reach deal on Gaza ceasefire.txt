DOHA, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Hamas have agreed to a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation efforts by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, the Qatari prime minister announced on Wednesday.
In a press conference, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said the two conflicting parties in Gaza have reached an agreement regarding the exchange of hostages and prisoners and return to sustainable calm that would lead to a permanent ceasefire.
He added that implementation of the agreement will begin on Sunday, Jan. 19.
According to the agreement, Hamas will release 33 hostages in the first phase, spanning six weeks, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.

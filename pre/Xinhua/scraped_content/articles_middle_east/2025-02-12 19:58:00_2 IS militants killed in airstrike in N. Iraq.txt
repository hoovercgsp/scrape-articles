BAGHDAD, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Islamic State (IS) militants were killed in an airstrike in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk, the Iraqi military said Wednesday.
Acting on intelligence, Iraqi forces conducted an airstrike on Sunday, targeting an IS hideout in the rugged area in Kirkuk, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
A joint force of army and intelligence personnel searched the bombed area on Wednesday, where they found the bodies of two militants, with one identified as Adnan Khalil Jad'an, nicknamed Haji Awad, and the other believed to be an IS leader who will be identified later, the statement said.
It noted that the forces found various weapons, mobile phones, and other logistical supplies in the hideout.
While Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, remnants of the group continue to carry out attacks against security forces and civilians in urban areas, deserts, and remote regions. â–

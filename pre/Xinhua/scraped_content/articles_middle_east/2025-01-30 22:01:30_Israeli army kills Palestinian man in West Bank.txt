RAMALLAH, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli special forces shot and killed a Palestinian man on Thursday in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian officials said.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that it had been informed by the General Authority of Civil Affairs of the death of Qasim Aboud Mutie Aklik, who was killed by Israeli forces in Nablus.
Ghassan Daghlas, governor of Nablus, told Xinhua that Israeli special forces entered a neighborhood in Nablus disguised as civilians and shot Aklik, who had previously been arrested and spent time in Israeli prisons. The forces also took his body, he said.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment.
Violence in the West Bank has escalated since Oct. 7, 2023. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire and shelling during that period, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. â–

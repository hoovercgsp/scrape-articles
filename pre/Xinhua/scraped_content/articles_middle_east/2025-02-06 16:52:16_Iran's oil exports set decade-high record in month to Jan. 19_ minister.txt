TEHRAN, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's oil exports set a 10-year-high record from Dec. 21, 2024 to Jan. 19, 2025, official news agency IRNA quoted Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad as saying on Wednesday.
The minister made the remarks on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting. However, Paknejad did not provide details about the exports' volume and value.
Commenting on his ministry's measures to counter Western sanctions on Iran's oil sector, he noted, "We have the readiness to work out solutions and achieve our desired objectives under any circumstances. If the sanctions continue, our strategies will continue according to the circumstances."
Reacting to an executive order signed on Tuesday by U.S. President Donald Trump to restore the so-called "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran, Paknejad said, "I believe that the maximum pressure (campaign) is a failed theory and if they seek to test it on Iran's people, it will be defeated (again)."
The United States intensified its sanctions against Iran's oil sector in 2018 after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, between Tehran and world powers. Despite the sanctions, Iran has continued to produce and export oil in large volumes. â–

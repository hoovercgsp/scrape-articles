ANKARA, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin held talks with Hamas' political bureau officials on Monday regarding ongoing efforts for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Türkiye's semi-official Anadolu Agency reported.
Kalin held phone talks with Hamas representatives, reviewing the progress and current status of the ongoing Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Anadolu quoted Turkish sources as saying.
Both parties reportedly agreed on the importance of continuing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire.
Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel in Qatar's Doha have made progress toward a ceasefire agreement, Palestinian and Israeli officials confirmed on Monday.
Hamas militants stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 others as hostages. Of these, 98 remain in captivity in Gaza, with at least a third believed to have died.
Israel's military campaign in response has caused widespread devastation in Gaza. Hamas-run health authorities reported on Monday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 46,584 people in Gaza. ■

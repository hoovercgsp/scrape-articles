DAMASCUS, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian authorities have issued public tenders to import oil and its derivatives, aiming to improve the efficiency of imports and foster a competitive environment in the country, according to a report by the state-run SANA news agency on Monday.
"We seek to make the oil sector in Syria highly transparent and gain people's trust," the report quoted Ghaiath Diab, oil and mineral resources minister in the Syrian interim government, as saying.
Previously, Diab said that Syria's largest oil refinery, the Baniyas Refinery, was undergoing equipment maintenance and would restart production to help meet the nation's fuel needs after the arrival of crude oil shipments.
The oil sector in Syria suffers from several difficulties and challenges, including sanctions imposed on the country, which have hindered securing oil derivatives. Diab has called for lifting the sanctions to restore the pace of economic life, according to local media reports. â–

GAZA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on Sunday accused Israel of delaying the Gaza relief and reconstruction process despite the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.
"The occupation is still procrastinating in implementing the relief and reconstruction process outlined in the ceasefire agreement, failing to fully commit to several humanitarian areas," said Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem in a press release.
"Despite the massive destruction in the healthcare sector, the occupation has not allowed any restoration work or the entry of necessary medical supplies," said Qassem, adding that the fuel entering Gaza "remains far below what the agreement specified."
He called on the mediators and guarantors of the ceasefire agreement to compel Israel to urgently allow the entry of relief materials as stipulated in the agreement, especially tents, fuel, food supplies and heavy machinery, and to halt all other violations and transgressions.
Since Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas and Israel had been engaged in a fierce conflict claiming tens of thousands of lives, before they agreed on a ceasefire deal, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, on Jan. 19.
The agreement is divided into three phases. The first phase, lasting 42 days, involves the release of 33 Israeli hostages and over 1,890 Palestinian prisoners. Negotiations for the next phases are still going on. â–

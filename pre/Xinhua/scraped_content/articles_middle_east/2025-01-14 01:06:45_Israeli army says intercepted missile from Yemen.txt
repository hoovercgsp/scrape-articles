JERUSALEM, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military said its aerial defense system intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen on Monday evening.
"One projectile launched from Yemen was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory," the military said in a statement.
The missile activated sirens in the north of the occupied West Bank, Jezreel Valley, and Beit She'an Valley, the military added, noting no casualties were immediately reported.
The incident followed the military's interception of a drone launched by Houthi forces from Yemen in the morning. â–

GAZA, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Hamas delivered its written approval for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to the mediators in Qatar, a Palestinian official source said on Wednesday.
"Hamas leadership delivered its approval to the Qatari, Egyptian, and American mediators after receiving Israel's plans on withdrawing its army from Gaza," the Palestinian source informed of the indirect negotiations held in Doha told Xinhua.
The source said that "Hamas is ready to implement the ceasefire in Gaza that would end the suffering of the Palestinian people."
Israel has not commented on the issue, but its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied earlier in the day media reports claiming Hamas had given final approval to the ceasefire deal.
On Tuesday, both parties said the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostage deal reached the "final stages."
Meanwhile, locals in Gaza confirmed that the Israeli army started to dismantle the military points in the Netzarim Corridor that separates Gaza's north and south. â–

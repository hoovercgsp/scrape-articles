ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's pro-government forces thwarted an attack by militants of the Yemen-based al-Qaeda factions targeting a military installation in the country's southern province of Abyan on Thursday, a security official told Xinhua.
The official said on condition of anonymity that a unit of the 2nd Brigade of Yemen's pro-government forces successfully defended against a "treacherous attack" by al-Qaeda militants in Omran Valley at dawn.
Intense clashes persisted for some three hours, resulting in casualties for the terrorist group, and ultimately forcing them to retreat from the battlefield, the official said, without specifying the number of the casualties.
The pro-government forces remain "fully vigilant and ready to respond urgently to any threat and confront all terrorist attempts," the official added.
Meanwhile, a medical source told Xinhua that at least six soldiers from the pro-government forces were injured during the engagement, with some sustaining critical wounds.
Al-Qaeda factions have been exploiting Yemen's protracted civil war and fragile security environment to consolidate their presence, particularly in the south.
In late 2022, the Yemeni government and Southern Transitional Council initiated a counter-terrorism campaign to dismantle al-Qaeda strongholds across Abyan province.
Yemen has been mired in a devastating civil war since late 2014, with the Houthis battling the internationally recognized government. â–

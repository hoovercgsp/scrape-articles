JERUSALEM, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Monday killed Ihab Abu Atiwi, the head of Hamas in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, said a joint statement issued by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency (ISA).
"During a joint IDF and ISA counterterrorism activity, an IAF aircraft struck and eliminated Ihab Abu Atiwi, a terrorist who served as the head of Hamas in Tulkarm, and an additional terrorist," the statement read.
It added that Abu Atiwi was involved in numerous shooting attacks, including an attack on an Israeli vehicle at the Ramin junction in the West Bank in July last year, in which three Israelis were injured.
The statement noted that his killing was part of the intensive operations conducted by the ISA and IDF against "terrorist networks" in the northern West Bank. â–

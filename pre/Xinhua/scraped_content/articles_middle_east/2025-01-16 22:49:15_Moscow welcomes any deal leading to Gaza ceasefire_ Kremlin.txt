MOSCOW, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Moscow supports any agreement that could lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.
"Any settlement that leads to a ceasefire and an end to the suffering of the people in Gaza, that contributes to Israel's security, can only be welcomed," Peskov said, commenting on the deal at a daily briefing.
Israel and Hamas have agreed on a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, Qatar's prime minister announced on Wednesday. The agreement includes an initial 42-day phase, during which more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt. â–

JERUSALEM, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military said on Sunday evening that its warplanes struck sites in Lebanon, claiming they were Hezbollah military positions containing rocket launchers and weapons, amid a fragile ceasefire between the two countries.
According to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA), warplanes carried out two airstrikes on the outskirts of the town of Harbata and a third airstrike on the town of Halbata, both located in the northern Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
Israeli warplanes also launched an airstrike on the Wadi al-Zayni, a town north of Sidon in southern Lebanon, said the NNA.
An Israeli military spokesperson said in a statement that "Hezbollah activity had been identified" in these sites, which contained rocket launchers and weapons. Militant activity at these sites "constitutes a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon," the spokesperson said.
The strikes were the latest in a series of Israeli military actions in Lebanon, fueling concerns over rising regional tensions.
Israel has continued to carry out occasional strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon despite a ceasefire agreement that has been in effect since Nov. 27. Israel postponed the deadline for the full withdrawal of its forces from Lebanon to Feb. 18 after missing the first deadline, and Lebanon has rejected any further extension. â–

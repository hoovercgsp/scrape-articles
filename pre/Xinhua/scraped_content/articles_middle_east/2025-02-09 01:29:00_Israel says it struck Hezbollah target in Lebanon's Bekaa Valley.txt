JERUSALEM, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military said on Saturday its air force struck a Hezbollah target in the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the strike targeted a "strategic weapons manufacturing and storage site" belonging to Hezbollah.
The IDF claimed the activity at the site constituted "a broad violation of the understanding between Israel and Lebanon."
The statement added that the IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to Israel and will prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to rebuild its forces, under the ceasefire understandings.
A ceasefire that took effect in November 2024, halted the year-long conflict between Hamas and Israel. Despite the truce, Israeli military forces launched sporadic attacks in Lebanon, saying they were targeting Hezbollah positions that violated the ceasefire agreement.
The Lebanese government has repeatedly condemned the Israeli attacks. After Israel failed to meet the initial withdrawal deadline from southern Lebanon, authorities extended the deadline to Feb. 18. â–

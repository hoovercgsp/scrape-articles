DAMASCUS, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Syrian security forces on Thursday destroyed large quantities of narcotics seized in western rural Damascus, an official from the narcotics bureau told Xinhua.
The illegal drugs were incinerated at former military sites, where authorities dug pits to burn the confiscated drugs, the official said.
Among the haul were 4 tonnes of crystal meth and 30 tonnes of precursor chemicals used to produce Captagon. The items were discovered on a farm in the Yafour area, just outside Damascus, according to the official.
In a separate operation in the nearby town of al-Saboura, authorities uncovered a storehouse containing thousands of tramadol pills, all packaged and ready for distribution.
Officials did not disclose details regarding arrests or the ongoing investigation into related trafficking networks. â–

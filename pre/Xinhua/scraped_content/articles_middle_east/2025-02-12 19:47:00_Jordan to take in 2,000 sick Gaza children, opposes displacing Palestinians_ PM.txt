AMMAN, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is ready to receive 2,000 sick Gaza children for medical treatment, as the healthcare system in the coastal enclave has been devastated, Prime Minister Jaafar Hassan announced Wednesday.
According to Jordan's state-run Petra news agency, during a parliamentary session, Hassan reaffirmed Jordan's clear and unwavering position that there should be no resettlement nor displacement of Palestinians and that no solutions to the Palestinian issue should come at Jordan's expense.
Jordan will not act unilaterally on matters concerning the future of Palestine and the region, he said, adding that the country is working with Arab nations, alongside Egypt and Palestinians, to formulate a unified and clear Arab position on Gaza's reconstruction.
He said that supporting Palestinians' resilience and defending their just rights are at the core of Jordan's efforts, and a just resolution to the Palestinian cause based on the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the foundation of achieving regional security, stability, and peace.
He added that Jordan's stability and security, and the protection of its people, are paramount.
Hassan's remarks came a day after Jordanian King Abdullah II rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during his visit to Washington.
Earlier, Trump had proposed that the United States should take control of Gaza and that the Palestinians be relocated to neighboring Jordan and Egypt, which has been widely condemned.
Trump later threatened that the United States "could conceivably withhold aid" from Jordan and Egypt if the two countries did not agree to receive Palestinians. â–

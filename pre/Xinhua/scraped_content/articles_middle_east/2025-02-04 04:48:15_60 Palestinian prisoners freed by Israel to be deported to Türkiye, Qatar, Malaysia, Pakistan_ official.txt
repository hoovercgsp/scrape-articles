RAMALLAH, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official announced on Monday that 60 Palestinian prisoners, released by Israel as part of a ceasefire deal and currently in Egypt, will be deported to Türkiye, Qatar, Malaysia, and Pakistan.
Abdullah Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, said each of the four countries would host 15 Palestinian prisoners, adding that there are currently 70 Palestinian prisoners staying in a hotel in the New Administrative Capital of Egypt, pending deportation.
Zaghari mentioned that discussions are ongoing with other countries to secure hosting for the remaining prisoners, and talks are also in progress with Cairo to accommodate some of those who may be released in future batches.
Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, acting as mediators, announced in a joint statement on Jan. 15 that Hamas and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement that includes the exchange of prisoners and hostages, aiming for sustained calm and a permanent ceasefire between the two sides.
Since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19, Hamas has released 18 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinians from its prisons.
According to a recent report by the Times of Israel, Israel demanded that Palestinians convicted of the most serious crimes not be released to the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. Egypt agreed to temporarily host these individuals. ■

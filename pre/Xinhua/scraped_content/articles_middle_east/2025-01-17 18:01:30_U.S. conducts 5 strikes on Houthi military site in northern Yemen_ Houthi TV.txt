SANAA, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military conducted five strikes on a Houthi military site in Yemen's province of Amran to the north of the capital Sanaa on Friday morning, said the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.
The strikes hit the outpost in the Harf Sufyan district in northern Amran, said the television, not giving further details, as the rebel group, which controls much of northern Yemen, rarely discloses its casualties or losses.
Residents wrote on social media that they heard a series of loud explosions at dawn from the Houthi military outpost, where weapons are stored underneath rocky hills.
The U.S. Central Command has not commented yet on the strikes.
The Houthi military site, along with other military outposts in other northern provinces and the capital Sanaa, has been frequently targeted by U.S. air raids since January 2024.
The fresh strikes came a few hours after the group's leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi vowed in a televised speech that his group would continue launching long-range rocket attacks on Israel if the Israeli forces kept raiding the Gaza Strip before the implementation of the announced Gaza ceasefire deal. â–

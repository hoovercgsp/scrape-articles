BAGHDAD, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Six Islamic State (IS) militants, including a senior leader, were killed in an airstrike in Iraq's northern province of Kirkuk, the Iraqi military said on Friday.
Iraqi security forces found the bodies of six IS militants, including the group's deputy leader in the Kirkuk area, in an IS hideout that was destroyed in a recent airstrike by Iraqi forces in the Hamrin mountain range, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

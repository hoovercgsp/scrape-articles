SANAA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- At least five Yemeni soldiers were killed on Wednesday during clashes with Houthi forces in the oil-rich province of Marib, central Yemen, a military source reported.
The fighting erupted after sunset on a front line in the Raghwan district, north of Marib, with both sides deploying artillery and drones, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The Houthi group has made no comment yet on the clashes.
Government troops currently control central Marib, including its oil and gas fields, while the Houthis hold several districts on the province's northern and southern edges.
Sporadic clashes have continued since a fragile truce was reached in 2022. However, tensions have escalated this month in Marib, with both sides massing forces along battlefronts.
Yemen has been engulfed in a civil war since late 2014, when the Houthi group seized control of several northern provinces, forcing the internationally recognized government to flee the capital Sanaa. â–

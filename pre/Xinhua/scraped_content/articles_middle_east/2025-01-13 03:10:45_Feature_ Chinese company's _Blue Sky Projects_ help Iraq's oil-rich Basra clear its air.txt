BASRA, Iraq, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Hussein takes a deep breath as he rolls down his car window during his morning commute, something unthinkable just a few years ago in this oil-rich city where black smoke once dominated the skyline.
"The air in Basra is much better now," says Hussein, a petroleum engineer who, like many locals, has witnessed a remarkable transformation in this industrial hub's environment. Even on this crisp winter morning, the difference is palpable.
For decades, Iraq's economic lifeline -- the oil and gas sector -- has come at a steep environmental cost. The practice of gas flaring, where associated gas from oil production is burned off into the atmosphere, has cast a shadow, both literal and figurative, over cities like Basra, where residents have long suffered the consequences of industrial pollution.
But a series of ambitious environmental projects, led by Chinese enterprises and dubbed the "Blue Sky Projects" by the locals, is helping Iraq turn a corner in its battle against pollution while addressing chronic energy shortages.
At the heart of this transformation is the Basra Natural Gas Liquids (BNGL) project, a facility that captures and processes associated gas from three major oilfields. The project, built by China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), stands as a testament to what's possible when modern technology meets environmental consciousness.
"Every cubic meter of gas we process is one that won't be directly flared into Basra's skies," says Sun Baojun, the project manager, whose facility now produces enough dry gas to power nearby communities that have long struggled with electricity shortages. The numbers are impressive: 4.4 million cubic meters of dry gas and 2,600 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas daily.
In the sprawling al-Rumaila oilfield, where antiquated flare stacks once spewed black smoke into the air, change is visible. New low-pressure flaring systems are replacing the old "candlestick" flares, part of an upgrade project scheduled for completion by February 2025.
"By then, Basra's skies will be bluer, and the air even cleaner," says Wang Jingyang, who manages the upgrade project. His optimism reflected the broader mood of transformation in the region.
The initiative extends beyond gas processing. In a country blessed with abundant sunlight, Chinese engineers are helping Iraq harness solar power. A new one-megawatt solar station in the al-Rumaila oilfield, complete with energy storage systems, represents Iraq's steps toward renewable energy. The facility is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,600 tonnes annually -- a small but significant step in the country's environmental journey.
Wang Xianghui, senior vice president of CPECC Middle East Branch, emphasizes that embracing green development is a fundamental social responsibility for companies contributing to the high-quality advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"We aim to play our part in building a 'Green Silk Road,'" he concluded.
For Iraqi officials, these developments signal a new chapter in the nation's industrial development. At the inauguration ceremony of the BNGL project, Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani emphasized how these projects are not just environmental victories but economic ones, improving both livelihoods and air quality.
The World Bank estimates that Iraq wastes approximately 17 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually through flaring -- a stark reminder of both the challenge and the opportunity ahead. However, for residents like Hussein, the impact of these changes is measured in everyday moments: the simple pleasure of breathing cleaner air during a morning commute, a small but significant sign of progress in a city working to balance industrial might with environmental responsibility.

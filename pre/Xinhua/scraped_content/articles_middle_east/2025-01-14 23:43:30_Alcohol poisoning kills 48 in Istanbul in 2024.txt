ISTANBUL, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight people died due to alcohol poisoning in 2024 in Istanbul, and the government of Istanbul has decided to implement stronger measures to eliminate the sale and use of illegal or counterfeit alcohol, the office of Istanbul governor said on Tuesday.
"In Istanbul, due to the use of illegal and counterfeit alcohol, 110 people were poisoned in 2024, and 48 of them lost their lives," a statement by the office noted.
The authority believes that the current measures are insufficient to prevent the tragedies. To enhance market regulation, the authority has decided to impose penalties on businesses that sell illegal or counterfeit alcohol, according to the statement.
Additionally, alcohol businesses that do not possess a sales and service certificate issued by the Tobacco and Alcohol Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will also face penalties, the statement added. â–

JERUSALEM, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces have begun withdrawing from a key area in Gaza as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement that took effect last month, an Israeli government official said on Sunday.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told Xinhua that the pullout from the area dubbed by Israel as the Netzarim Corridor -- a strip of land that bisected Gaza from north to south -- is expected to be completed by late Sunday.
The Israeli military had established posts in the corridor during its 15-month-long assault on Gaza. An Israeli security official, talking to Xinhua anonymously, said that the military was "preparing to implement the agreement according to the guidelines of the political echelon."
Footage circulating on social media appeared to show troops setting fire to furniture and unidentified boxes at their bases, with a soldier heard shouting, "We will leave nothing for the Gazans."
The 42-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect on Jan. 19. Under the agreement, Israel committed to withdrawing its forces from the area. With the truce now past its midpoint, negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States are set to determine whether the ceasefire will continue into its second phase, which would include the release of more hostages and Palestinian detainees. â–

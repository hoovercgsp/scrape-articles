ISTANBUL, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish forces in 2024 "neutralized" 3,164 "terrorists," including 1,645 in northern Syria and 1,519 in the north of Iraq, Defense Ministry spokesperson Zeki Akturk said on Thursday.
At a press briefing held aboard a frigate in the southwestern province of Mugla, Akturk said that the Turkish forces are determined to continue cross-border operations if "terrorist groups do not lay down their arms," emphasizing respect for Syria's territorial integrity.
Akturk was referring to the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara considers the Syrian branch of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Turkish authorities often use the term "neutralize" in their statements to imply the alleged "terrorists" have either surrendered, been killed, or been captured.
Ankara has recently warned of a new military intervention in northern Syria to eliminate the Kurdish militants unless the group disarms after the fall of Bashar al-Assad's government.
Since 2016, Türkiye has launched anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to create a YPG-free zone, including Operation Euphrates Shield in 2016, Operation Olive Branch in 2018, and Operation Peace Spring in 2019 and 2020.
Türkiye launched Operation Claw-Lock in northern Iraq in 2022 to dismantle PKK hideouts. ■

RAMALLAH, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stressed Wednesday that the Palestinian territories are not for sale.
"The Palestinian people are committed to remaining on their land in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem," Abbas said in a press statement released by the Palestinian official news agency WAFA.
Abbas appreciated the positions of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other countries that reject any attempts to annex land or displace Palestinians, support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and call for a complete cessation of war.
He stressed the importance of coordinating Arab efforts and positions to adopt an Arab peace vision at the upcoming emergency Arab summit on the Palestinian issue in Cairo.
He also stressed the need to provide relief immediately to the people of Gaza, and for the State of Palestine to assume its responsibility in Gaza and rebuild the enclave with international support while the Palestinian people remain on their land.
Earlier, Trump proposed that the United States should take control of Gaza and that the Palestinians be relocated to neighboring Jordan and Egypt, which has been widely condemned. â–

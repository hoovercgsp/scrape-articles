GAZA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Khalil Al-Hayya, a member of Hamas' political bureau, announced on Tuesday that Gaza is entering a new phase focused on removing the effects of Israeli aggression and beginning the rebuilding process.
In a video message released by Hamas, Al-Hayya said, "We are now entering a new phase in our noble Gaza, a phase of construction, solidarity, and removing the effects of aggression to rebuild."
"We will rebuild Gaza, ease the pain, heal the wounds, and bring comfort to the orphans," he added.
Basem Naeem, another member of Hamas' political bureau, announced that people will be able to move freely between the southern and northern parts of the Gaza Strip "in both directions" on Jan. 25.
On Jan. 15, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire-for-hostages deal after intensive mediation by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States.
The ceasefire, which began on Jan. 19, has three phases. The first phase, lasting 42 days, includes the release of 33 Israeli hostages, while Israel will free over 1,890 Palestinian prisoners during this phase.
Since Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas and Israel have been engaged in a brutal war that has resulted in the deaths of about 47,000 Palestinians, a humanitarian crisis, and widespread destruction in Gaza.
The war began when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 Israelis and taking approximately 250 hostages. In response, Israel conducted massive retaliatory strikes. â–

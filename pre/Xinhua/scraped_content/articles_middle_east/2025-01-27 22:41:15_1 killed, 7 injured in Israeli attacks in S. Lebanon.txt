BEIRUT, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and seven others injured on Monday in Israeli attacks on civilians attempting to return to their still-occupied hometowns in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.
The ministry said the casualties were reported in the town of Adaisseh, the municipality of Bani Haiyyan, and the villages of Yaroun and Houla.
The violence comes as a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel expired at dawn on Sunday. The agreement, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024, required Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory within 60 days and the Lebanese army to deploy along the border and in the south to assume security and prevent the presence of weapons and militants.
Earlier on Monday, Lebanon's caretaker government announced the decision to extend the ceasefire with Israel until Feb. 18, as Israel failed to withdraw from southern Lebanon before the deadline set under the initial 60-day truce deal. â–

BAGHDAD, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi military revealed on Saturday the identities of three Islamic State (IS) militants killed in airstrikes in late January.
Tests conducted on the bodies of seven IS militants killed in airstrikes on a hideout in the Zarga area between Salahuddin and Kirkuk provinces on Jan. 31 revealed that important terrorist leaders were among the dead, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
The dead included Dahham Mohammed Aliwi, also known as Abu Saeed al-Dandoushi, the IS leader in Kirkuk province responsible for several terrorist attacks and the killing of innocent people, the statement said.
The other two were Shahatha Allawi Saleh, also known as Abu Issa, an IS official in charge of the Hamrin area, and Basim Rabi' al-Batoush, a key IS terrorist, it said.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have identified ancient proteins that may help explain how the first complex cells evolved from simpler ones over 1.5 billion years ago, Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) said in a statement on Tuesday.
The research, conducted by BGU researchers in collaboration with German scientists, focused on the transition from simple cells (prokaryotes), like bacteria, to complex cells (eukaryotes), which make up humans, plants, and animals.
A key to understanding this evolutionary leap lies with Asgard archaea, single-celled organisms discovered recently that thrive in extreme environments. These archaea possess proteins similar to those found in complex cells.
The study shows that a protein found in Asgard archaea can organize itself into structures resembling those in complex cells, performing similar functions. This suggests these proteins served as an evolutionary bridge between simple and complex cells.
The researchers found these proteins can also shape the cell membrane, a crucial structure for all cells, and bind to DNA, the cell's genetic material. This DNA binding could explain the formation of complex cell structures like the nucleus.
"These discoveries provide new and significant evidence about how complex cells evolved from simple cells," the BGU statement said, hailing the discovery as "an important step in understanding one of the key stages in the formation of life as we know it." â–

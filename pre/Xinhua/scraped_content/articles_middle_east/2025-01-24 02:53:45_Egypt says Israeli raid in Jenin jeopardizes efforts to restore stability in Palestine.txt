CAIRO, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's foreign ministry on Thursday condemned an Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, which has left dozens wounded and killed.
In a statement, the ministry warned of the operation's repercussions on the security and stability of the West Bank, cautioning that it could further escalate tensions in the region.
"The Israeli military operation conflicts with regional and international efforts to restore stability and calm in the occupied Palestinian territories, potentially leading to serious consequences," the statement said.
The Israeli army has been conducting a large-scale operation in Jenin and its surrounding refugee camp for the past three days, resulting in at least 12 deaths and dozens of injuries, according to figures from the Israeli military and the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. â–

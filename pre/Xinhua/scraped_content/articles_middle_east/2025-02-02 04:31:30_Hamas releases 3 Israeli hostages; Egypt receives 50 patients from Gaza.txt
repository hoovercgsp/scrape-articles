GAZA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hamas on Saturday released three Israeli hostages in the fourth batch of the first phase of the prisoner exchange and ceasefire deal. In return, Israel freed 183 Palestinian detainees and allowed 50 wounded and sick Palestinians to leave Gaza for medical treatment abroad.
The handover of hostages took place at two locations: Khan Younis in southern Gaza and the Gaza City in the north.
Hamas' armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, transferred 65-year-old Keith Shmonsel Segal, an Israeli-American citizen, to the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza.
Segal, dressed in dark clothing and carrying two envelopes containing gifts for him and his wife, waved to onlookers before being escorted to Israel.
Earlier in the day, al-Qassam fighters led Ofer Calderon, an Israeli-French citizen, and Yarden Bibas to a platform built on the ruins of a destroyed house, where images of Hamas leaders were displayed.
They were then handed over individually to the ICRC representatives.
The process unfolded under strict organizational control, accompanied by a military parade of armed Hamas militants.
Unlike the chaotic scenes of previous releases, the exchange was tightly managed, with heavy gunmen securing the area to prevent a repeat of the large crowds that had gathered in the previous transfer, raising concerns from the Israeli side.
The release is part of a broader ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States on Jan. 15.
Under the deal, the first phase -- lasting 42 days -- will see 33 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 1,890 Palestinian prisoners.
In a press statement, Hamas claimed it had provided medical care to the hostages despite "harsh conditions," contrasting its treatment of prisoners with what it described as Israel's "violations against Palestinian detainees."
It also cast the large turnout of Palestinians during the handover as a "referendum on resistance."
In return, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners.
According to Palestinian sources, 150 prisoners were transferred to Gaza, including those serving life and long-term sentences, while 32 others were sent to the West Bank.
An additional Egyptian detainee was also freed, according to Palestinian sources.
West Bank prisoners were freed from Ofer Prison near Ramallah, while those from Gaza were transferred from Ketziot Prison in the Negev to the Kerem Shalom crossing.
Seven of the released detainees are set to be deported abroad.
Meanwhile, for the first time in eight months, 50 wounded Palestinians and patients were allowed to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing for treatment in Egypt, under the supervision of the World Health Organization (WHO).
On Saturday, Egypt announced the reopening of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which had been closed since May 2024 when Israel took control of the Palestinian side.
Patients gathered at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis before being transported to the crossing, with critical cases evacuated by Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances.
Mohammed Zaqout, director general of hospitals in Gaza, told Xinhua that more than 6,000 wounded and sick Palestinians require urgent treatment, with 12,000 in need of care abroad.
Israeli media outlets reported that the Israeli army withdrew from the Rafah crossing on Friday, handing control to international forces, and approved the list of patients permitted to leave.
Gaza remains in the grip of a worsening humanitarian crisis. WHO representative Rick Peeperkorn warned that only 18 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functional, as medical supplies dwindle and casualties mount. â–

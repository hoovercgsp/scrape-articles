TEHRAN, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Basij voluntary force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) staged a large-scale drill in the capital Tehran on Friday, the official news agency IRNA reported.
The exercise involved 110,000 Basij members and displayed various kinds of military gear, said the report, adding it aimed to demonstrate the Basij force's "all-out readiness" for any threat and professional skills in carrying out rescue and relief operations, defending the homeland and countering terrorist activities.
The Iranian armed forces have launched several drills, including an air defense exercise near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in the central Isfahan province, over the past few days and plan to hold more during the coming weeks to maintain and improve military preparedness against potential threats. â–

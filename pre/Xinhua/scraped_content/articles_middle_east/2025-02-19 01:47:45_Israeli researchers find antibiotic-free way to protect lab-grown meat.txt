JERUSALEM, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have discovered a new way to prevent bacterial contamination in lab-grown meat without antibiotics, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said Tuesday.
Antimicrobial peptides, a class of small peptides widely existing in nature, are an important part of the innate immune system of different organisms. They have inhibitory effects against bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.
The new study, published in Food Chemistry: Molecular Sciences, found that antimicrobial peptides mixtures (RPMs) can effectively kill harmful bacteria like Listeria and E. coli while preserving the cells needed to grow cultured meat.
Lab-grown meat, seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional farming, is challenged by bacterial infections. While antibiotics are commonly used, they risk promoting drug-resistant bacteria and leaving harmful residues in the final product.
According to the study, RPMs, which break down quickly during digestion, offer a safer solution. They show low bacterial resistance, no damage to meat-producing cells, and no risk of bioaccumulation or adverse health effects.
The researchers said RPMs can be a promising tool for improving food safety and consumer trust in cultured meat products. They are now working to integrate RPMs into industrial processes and regulatory frameworks for commercial production. â–

BAGHDAD, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Five Islamic State (IS) militants were killed on Wednesday in an airstrike in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, the Iraqi military said.
Acting on intelligence reports, Iraqi forces spotted five IS militants in a cave north of the city of Rawa, some 300 km northwest of Baghdad, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
Following accurate monitoring, Iraqi forces carried out an airstrike, killing them all and destroying their weapons, ammunition, and other equipment, it added.
While Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, remnants of the group continue to carry out attacks against security forces and civilians in urban areas, deserts, and remote regions. â–

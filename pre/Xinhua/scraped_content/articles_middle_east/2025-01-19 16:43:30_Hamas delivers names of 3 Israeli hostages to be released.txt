GAZA, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic Hamas movement delivered on Sunday the names of the three hostages who would be released today, a Palestinian official source said on Sunday.
The source told Xinhua that Hamas had delivered the names of the three hostages in the upcoming minutes to start the ceasefire in Gaza.
Earlier in the day, Hamas said that the delay in delivering the names of the hostages came as a result of field technical reasons, adding that it is committed to the ceasefire agreement. â–

KUWAIT CITY, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- As hundreds of millions across China gather with loved ones to celebrate the Chinese New Year, a team of Chinese construction workers in Kuwait's expansive desert is pushing forward with an ambitious housing project, making the most of the country's brief, cooler winter months to accelerate progress.
The project, part of Kuwait's South Sabah Al-Ahmad New City development, highlights deepening ties between the Gulf state and China. Under the relentless desert sun, workers from the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) are toiling on the construction site near the Kuwaiti-Saudi border, undeterred by sandstorms and other daily challenges.
Launched on Sep. 1, 2024, the 305.8-million-U.S.-dollar project aims to deliver roads, utilities, and sewage systems for 7,623 housing units in South Sabah Al-Ahmad New City, the futuristic "smart city" located 80 kilometers south of Kuwait City.
By January 2025, the site was buzzing with over 350 pieces of heavy machinery and a workforce of more than 450, including Chinese, Kuwaiti, Indian, and Sri Lankan laborers.
"Spring Festival is very special for us, but this work is important," said Zhang Fengkun, a field engineer from Tianjin, northern China. "We're striving to complete the project quickly to provide comfortable homes for Kuwaiti families. Though I miss my family, I'm proud to contribute to the friendship between China and Kuwait."
Despite the demanding work schedule, the spirit of the Spring Festival was not forgotten. The construction site's modest cafeteria was adorned with red lanterns and the Chinese character "Fu," symbolizing luck and prosperity. The workers gathered to share traditional festival foods and enjoy Chinese cultural performances, creating a warm atmosphere of cross-cultural celebration.
For many Chinese workers, the holiday is a time of longing. But they found solace and pride in their mission abroad. "It's a sacrifice, but it's worth it," said one worker.
The collaboration is not without its challenges. Harsh weather, language barriers, and cultural differences have tested the team's resilience. However, CSCEC's management has implemented measures to bridge these gaps, such as hiring Arabic-speaking Chinese managers and providing regular training for foreign workers.
"We've formed specialized technical groups to align with local standards while maintaining open communication with Kuwaiti authorities," said Zhu Xiangang, the project manager. "This ensures mutual understanding and smooth progress."
The broader impact of the project extends beyond housing. Local resident Abdullah Al-Dosari expressed optimism about its benefits. "This will transform our quality of life, improving housing and driving national development," he said.
Sherif, a young Kuwaiti worker, spoke of how the experience had broadened his horizons. "I've learned new skills and gained a deep appreciation for the dedication of Chinese workers," he said.
The partnership also reflects Kuwait's strategic alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative.
Tarek, an Egyptian project coordination manager, emphasized the value of this cooperation. "China's focus on mutual benefit ... creates a positive environment for regional peace and development," he said, urging Arab nations to strengthen ties with China.
As the winter months offer optimal construction conditions, the team is accelerating efforts to meet deadlines. For the workers, this endeavor transcends the physical structures they are building.
"This is more than just a project; it's a testament to the enduring friendship between China and Kuwait," Zhu said. â–

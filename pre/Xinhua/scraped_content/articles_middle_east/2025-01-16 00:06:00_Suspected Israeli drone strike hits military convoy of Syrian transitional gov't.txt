DAMASCUS, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- A suspected Israeli drone struck a military convoy in southern Syria's Quneitra province on Wednesday, killing three people and wounding another, according to a war monitor.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the drone targeted a convoy belonging to Syria's transitional Military Operations Administration in the village of Ghadir al-Bustan.
The blast reportedly killed one person and two members of the military operations force, while another was seriously injured and transported to a hospital for treatment. Images published showed smoke rising from the scene.
The Observatory said the strike occurred as the Military Operations Administration, linked to the interim government, was conducting a security sweep, searching civilian homes for weapons.
There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials or Syria's interim government.
The incident follows a separate drone strike earlier on Wednesday by the U.S.-led coalition in Sarmada, Idlib province, near the Turkish border, which the Observatory said wounded three people.
These are the first reported strikes targeting the new Syrian authorities by Israel and the U.S.-led coalition since the fall of the previous government in December 2024.
Israel has intensified aerial operations in Syria in recent months, citing concerns about hostile activity near its northern border. The new Syrian administration has pledged to restore order and unify security operations nationwide. â–

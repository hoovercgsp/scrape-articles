CAIRO, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- A meeting to discuss the implementation of the recent Gaza ceasefire agreement concluded in Cairo on a positive atmosphere, Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported Friday.
All necessary arrangements were agreed upon to ensure the successful implementation of the agreement, the channel quoted a well-informed official source as saying.
This includes the formation of a joint operations room in Cairo, comprised of representatives from Egypt, Palestine, Qatar, the United States, and Israel, which will play a crucial role in coordinating efforts and monitoring compliance with the terms of the agreement, the report said.
On Wednesday, Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, which have been mediating between Israel and Hamas to bring an end to the conflict in Gaza, announced in a joint statement that the two parties had agreed on a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal, along with a return to sustainable calm, aiming for a permanent ceasefire between them.
The agreement, expected to take effect on Sunday, includes an initial 42-day phase, during which more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt, and 33 hostages held in Gaza will be released in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. â–

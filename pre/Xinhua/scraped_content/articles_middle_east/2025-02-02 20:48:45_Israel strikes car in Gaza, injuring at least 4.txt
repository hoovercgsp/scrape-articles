JERUSALEM, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's air force struck a car in a convoy of displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Sunday, injuring at least four people, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
A child was among the injured and in critical condition, according to the newspaper. The child was transported to Al-Awda Hospital.
An Israeli military spokesperson confirmed that the strike targeted a vehicle on Al-Rasheed Street, northwest of the Nuseirat refugee camp. The spokesperson said the aircraft "fired to deter a suspicious vehicle moving north from central Gaza" after it attempted to cross into northern Gaza without inspection.
The military said it "remains prepared for any scenario and will continue to take all necessary actions to remove immediate threats to its forces."
The incident occurred after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas took effect on Jan. 19 following more than 15 months of fighting. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) --The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday it has carried out strikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon in recent days, targeting weapons storage facilities and observation posts used by the group.
In a statement, the IDF said its Northern Command forces conducted the operations to "remove threats" while adhering to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. The military remains deployed in southern Lebanon, monitoring Hezbollah's activities and prepared to respond to any threats to Israeli troops or the country, the statement added.
The ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024, requires Israel to withdraw all troops from southern Lebanon by Sunday. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Friday that forces would remain beyond the deadline, citing the Lebanese military's failure to establish full control over the area and Hezbollah's incomplete withdrawal north of the Litani River.
The Lebanese side has repeatedly accused Israel of violating the ceasefire during the past two months. â–

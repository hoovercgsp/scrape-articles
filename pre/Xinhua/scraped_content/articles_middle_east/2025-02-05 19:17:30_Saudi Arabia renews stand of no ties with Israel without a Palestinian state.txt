RIYADH, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia renewed on Wednesday its stand of no ties with Israel without a Palestinian state.
Saudi Arabia's unwavering position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is non-negotiable and not subject to compromises, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The country will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that, it said.
The country also reaffirms its unequivocal rejection of any infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, land annexation, or attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land, it said.
"Achieving lasting and just peace is impossible without the Palestinian people obtaining their legitimate rights in accordance with international resolutions, as has been previously clarified to both the former and current U.S. administrations," it added.
The Saudi statement followed U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks on Tuesday in a joint press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the United States will take ownership of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it after Palestinians are relocated elsewhere. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Two gunmen fired from a moving car at an Israeli bus and other vehicles in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday, killing three people and injuring seven, Israeli authorities said.
The attack occurred near al-Funduq, a Palestinian village in the northeastern West Bank, said the Israeli military in a statement.
The suspects fled the scene, triggering an Israeli manhunt. Large Israeli forces set up roadblocks and surrounded several nearby Palestinian towns, it added.
Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said the dead victims include two women in their 60s and a man in his 40s. Seven others were injured, among whom the bus driver was seriously wounded.
The attack occurred amid heightened tensions in the West Bank, marked by daily Israeli raids that frequently result in fatalities, alongside the ongoing conflict in Gaza. â–

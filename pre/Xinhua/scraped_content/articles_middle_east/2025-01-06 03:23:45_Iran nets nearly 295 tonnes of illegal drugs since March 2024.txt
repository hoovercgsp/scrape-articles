TEHRAN, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's anti-narcotics police have seized close to 295 tonnes of different kinds of illegal drugs since March 20, 2024, the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year, the official news agency IRNA reported Sunday.
While elaborating on police operations during the current Iranian year, Nasrollah Barin, deputy chief of the anti-narcotics police, told a press conference in the eastern province of South Khorasan that although smuggling of natural drugs into Iran has declined over the past three years, that of synthetic drugs, like methamphetamine, has risen.
Barin said the police have seized 25 tonnes of methamphetamine since March 2024, up 10 percent year-on-year, IRNA reported.
The police have increased their focus on Iran's eastern borders, through which the major part of illegal drugs are smuggled into the country, Barin noted. â–

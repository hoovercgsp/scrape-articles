ISTANBUL, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, will hike public transport and taxi fares by 35 percent, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday.
The Istanbul Municipality's Transportation Coordination Centre (UKOME) said bus fares would rise to 27 Turkish lira (0.76 U.S. dollar) from 20 lira, while discounted student tickets would increase to 13.18 lira from 9.76 lira, the agency reported.
A full-route Metrobus trip across the city will now cost 40.08 lira, while Marmaray commuter train fares will rise to 59.76 lira.
Istanbul, spanning Europe and Asia, relies heavily on public transport, with three bridges and the Marmaray underwater rail tunnel connecting the two continents.
A worker commuting from the Asian to the European side using both a bus and Metrobus will now face a daily round-trip cost of 134 lira. The 2025 minimum wage in Türkiye, recently increased by 30 percent, is 22,104 lira.
Taxi fares will also increase, with the minimum fare rising to 135 lira from 100 lira and the taximeter start fee jumping 40 percent to 42 lira.
The new fares are expected to take effect in the coming days. ■

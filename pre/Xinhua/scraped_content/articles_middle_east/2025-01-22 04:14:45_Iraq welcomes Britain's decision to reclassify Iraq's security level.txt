BAGHDAD, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Iraq welcomes Britain's decision to downgrade its security classification, which reflects the improved security situation in the country,
Britain's step is an important achievement that reflects the Iraqi government's ongoing efforts to achieve stability and enhance a safe and encouraging environment for investment, said the ministry in a statement.
It noted that lowering the security risk level in Iraq will pave the way for British companies to enter the country's market.
The ministry also called on other Western countries to review their security classifications for Iraq, reiterating its commitment to working with international partners to strengthen bilateral relations and provide an appropriate environment for expanding cooperation across various areas.
This announcement follows a decision by Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office to ease travel advisories for large parts of Iraq. â–

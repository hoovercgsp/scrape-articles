DOHA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- A Qatari Armed Forces plane carrying 28 tons of humanitarian aid, including essential food supplies, landed in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Tuesday, the Qatari Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The aid, part of Qatar's ongoing air bridge initiative to support the Syrian people, is provided by the Qatar Fund for Development, a government entity focused on improving global livelihoods, the ministry said.
It marks the seventh aid plane to land at Damascus International Airport and the 12th dispatched under the Qatari air bridge initiative, the ministry said.
According to a report by Syrian state television, Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani arrived in Damascus on Thursday, marking a significant step in strengthening bilateral relations since the fall of the previous Syrian government in December 2024. â–

BAGHDAD, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Turkish drone strikes on Thursday killed three militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Sulaymaniyah province in northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, the local Counter-Terrorism Service said in a statement.
The drone strikes occurred near noon, targeting two vehicles and a PKK hideout in the village of Galala, north of the namesake provincial capital Sulaymaniyah, according to the statement.
The airstrikes resulted in the killing of three PKK militants, including a senior military official, while two others were reported missing, the statement said.
Turkish forces frequently carry out cross-border operations targeting PKK militants in northern Iraq, especially in the Qandil Mountains, the main base of the group.
The PKK, designated as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States, and the European Union, has rebelled against the Turkish government for more than three decades. ■

ABU DHABI, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has successfully doubled its clean energy capacity from 3.1 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts between 2022 and 2024, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment Amna bint Abdullah Al Dahak announced on Sunday.
The announcement was made during the opening of the 15th session of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Assembly in Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE.
Al Dahak reaffirmed the UAE's commitment, established during the UN climate change conference, COP28, in 2023, to expand its renewable energy capacity to 14.2 gigawatts by 2030.
Emphasizing the urgency of accelerating the clean energy transition, the minister cited the growing frequency of climate-induced disasters such as floods, droughts, and wildfires that displace communities worldwide.
She also highlighted the UAE's sustained leadership in renewable energy innovation since hosting the first IRENA Assembly in 2011. "Renewable energy is now more affordable, accessible, and scalable than ever before," Al Dahak said, pointing to advancements in energy storage and technology as key enablers for achieving a just energy transition. â–

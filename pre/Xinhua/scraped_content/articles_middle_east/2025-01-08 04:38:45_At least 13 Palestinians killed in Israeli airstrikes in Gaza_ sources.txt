GAZA, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 Palestinians, including five children, were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian sources on Tuesday.
Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Civil Defense in Gaza, told Xinhua that Israeli warplanes struck a house in Jabalia, north of the Strip, with at least one missile, killing at least five people and injuring 20 others.
Israeli aircraft also targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in the Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local sources and eyewitnesses.
Paramedics told Xinhua that medical teams retrieved the bodies of five children and rescued several other injured people following the strike, which caused the tent to catch fire.
In addition, Israeli warplanes struck a vehicle in the Al-Manara neighborhood, east of Khan Younis, killing three people inside, according to Palestinian medical sources.
Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.

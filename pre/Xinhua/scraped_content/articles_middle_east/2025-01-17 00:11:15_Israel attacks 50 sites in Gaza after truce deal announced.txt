JERUSALEM, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military said it struck about 50 sites across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, a day after it agreed to a ceasefire deal with Hamas.
In a statement, the military said the strikes targeted a militant who took part in the Hamas-led onslaught on Israeli communities in October 2023. The militant "participated in the massacre at the Nova Music Festival," the military said.
It also attacked other Hamas and Islamic Jihad military compounds, weapons storage and manufacturing facilities, launch posts, and observation posts, according to the statement.
In an update earlier on Thursday, Gaza's health authorities said that Israeli airstrikes in the besieged Palestinian enclave had killed 81 people and injured nearly 200 others over the past day. â–

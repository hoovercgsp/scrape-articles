DAMASCUS, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A powerful explosion shook neighborhoods in the city of Hama on Monday, with thick plumes of smoke rising from the western part of the city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.
The cause of the blast remains unclear, and there has been no immediate confirmation from local authorities regarding casualties or damage.
Meanwhile, a local news outlet Step News Agency said the blast occurred inside the Hama military airbase.
It said a tank exploded during an attempt to dismantle an explosive projectile attached to it.
The explosion comes amid heightened security tensions in various parts of Syria as the new authorities continue operations against remnants of the previous regime and other armed groups. â–

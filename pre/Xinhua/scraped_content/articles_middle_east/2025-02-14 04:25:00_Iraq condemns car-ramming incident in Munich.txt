BAGHDAD, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry expressed on Thursday its strong condemnation of the car-ramming incident in the German city of Munich, which resulted in injuries to a number of innocent civilians.
The ministry confirmed in a statement its "full solidarity with the government and people of Germany in facing this criminal incident," stressing Iraq's firm position in rejecting violence and terrorism in all forms.
According to Munich police, at least 28 people, including children, were injured after a car plowed into a crowd in Munich on Thursday.

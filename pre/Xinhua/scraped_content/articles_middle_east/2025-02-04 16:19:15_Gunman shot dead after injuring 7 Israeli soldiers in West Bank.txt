JERUSALEM, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian gunman shot and injured seven checkpoint soldiers in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday before he was shot dead by troops, Israeli authorities said.
Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said two of the wounded were in critical condition and were airlifted to hospitals.
The military said the assailant approached soldiers stationed at an outpost near the Tayasir checkpoint in the northern Jordan Valley and opened fire. The soldiers killed the attacker in an exchange of fire, the statement said.
The incident came two days after the Israeli military announced it was expanding its large-scale operation in the northern West Bank to the town of Tammun, near the Tayasir checkpoint.
At least 27 people have been killed by Israeli forces since the offensive began in Jenin last month, according to Palestinian figures. â–

SANAA, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group on Monday night took responsibility for launching a ballistic missile at the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
"We carried out a military operation targeting a vital target of the Israeli enemy in Tel Aviv, using a hypersonic ballistic missile," Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.
"The operation achieved its goal successfully," he said, adding that his group also carried out an attack using four drones and targeted "vital targets" in Tel Aviv.
Sarea vowed that his group's attacks against Israel "will continue until aggression on Gaza Strip" stops.
Earlier in the day, Israeli media reported the interception of a "missile launched from Yemen" which disrupted air traffic in Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.
Since November 2023, the Houthis has been carrying out rocket and drone attacks on Israel, and disrupting "Israeli-linked" shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians amid the conflict in Gaza. â–

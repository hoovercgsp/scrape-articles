JERUSALEM, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel recorded 439 traffic fatalities in 2024, a 21.6 percent rise compared to the 361 deaths registered in 2023, according to a statement issued by the Israel Bureau of Statistics on Sunday.
The bureau noted that the number of fatalities last year was the highest since 2006, when 439 people were killed in traffic accidents in Israel.
The number of fatal accidents in the country rose by 19.8 percent year-on-year, from 338 in 2023 to 405 in 2024.
The main causes of traffic accidents resulting in fatalities or serious injuries in 2024 were failure to yield to pedestrians, ignoring traffic lights, lane crossing, and excessive speed, Israel's National Road Safety Authority revealed in a press release in early January. â–

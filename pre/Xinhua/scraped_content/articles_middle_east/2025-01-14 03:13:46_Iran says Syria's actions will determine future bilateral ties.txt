TEHRAN, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday that Iran's future relations with Syria depend on Syria's actions.
He made the remarks at a weekly press conference in the capital Tehran, while commenting on the latest developments in Syria and the possibility of resuming ties with Damascus.
Baghaei reiterated Iran's stance that the Syrian people should be allowed to determine their own fate without any "destructive" foreign interference. He added Iran attaches great importance to Syria's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, towards which the West Asia region should spare no effort.
Baghaei said Iran supports any process that would contribute to a safe and secure transition in Syria and prevent the violation of the state's national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
A Syrian militant alliance led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group toppled former President Bashar al-Assad's government on Dec. 8, 2024. The militant groups also stormed Iran's embassy in Damascus, which had been vacated before the attack. Iran has long been a staunch ally of al-Assad's government in the region. â–

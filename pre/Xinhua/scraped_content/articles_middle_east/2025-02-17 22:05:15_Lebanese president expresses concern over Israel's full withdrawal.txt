BEIRUT, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on Monday voiced concerns over whether Israel would completely withdraw from southern Lebanon on Tuesday.
"We fear that the complete withdrawal may not be achieved tomorrow, and Lebanon's response will come through a unified national stance," he said.
"War is not a viable option," Aoun affirmed in a statement released by Lebanon's Presidency, adding that diplomatic channels will be prioritized since Lebanon cannot endure another conflict. He also confirmed that the Lebanese army is ready to deploy in villages and towns vacated by Israeli forces.
Also on Monday, the Lebanese president met with the five-member committee overseeing the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire agreement. The committee confirmed its ongoing diplomatic efforts to finalize the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as soon as possible.
Israeli forces are scheduled to pull out from southern Lebanon by Feb. 18 after an already extended deadline but expressed intention to maintain positions at five key strategic locations in the area, which was roundly rejected by the Lebanese government. â–

BEIRUT, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam on Monday condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks suggesting a Palestinian state be established on Saudi territory, asserting that Palestinians have the right to statehood in their homeland.
In a statement from his office, Salam described Netanyahu's stance as an extension of aggression against Arab nations and an interference in their internal affairs. He reaffirmed Palestinian rights to an independent state on their own land, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative adopted at the 2002 Arab Summit in Beirut.
Salam also backed Egypt's call for an emergency Arab summit on Feb. 27, warning of what he termed a "dangerous scheme" targeting Palestine, its people, and the broader Arab world. He urged a unified Arab response to counter efforts that could lead to destruction and displacement.
Lebanon's Foreign Ministry also issued a statement on Monday, strongly rejecting Netanyahu's comments and expressing solidarity with Saudi Arabia in defending its security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The ministry reiterated Lebanon's opposition to any attempts to displace or resettle Palestinians, particularly in Lebanon, and called for renewed efforts toward a just and comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian issue based on a two-state solution and international legitimacy.
Netanyahu's comments followed Saudi Arabia's reaffirmation that it would not establish diplomatic ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state. â–

AMMAN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan signed two agreements with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development on Monday, securing about 65 million U.S. dollars to finance education and infrastructure projects, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation said.
The agreements, each worth 10 million Kuwaiti dinars (approximately 32.6 million U.S. dollars), will fund the third phase of the Public Education Infrastructure Project and the Roads and Bridges Rehabilitation Project, the ministry said in a statement.
The funding is part of a 500-million-dollar concessional loan program from Kuwait, pledged at the 2018 Mecca Summit, to support development priorities in Jordan.
From 1962 to 2024, development cooperation between Jordan and the Kuwait Fund has totaled approximately 2.1 billion dollars, including around 1.33 billion dollars in grants and about 778 million dollars in concessional loans, the ministry said. â–

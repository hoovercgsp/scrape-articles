RAMALLAH, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli strikes have damaged 226 archaeological sites in Gaza during the war, with repair costs estimated at 261 million euros, according to a report released by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities on Wednesday.
The damage assessment revealed that 138 sites suffered significant damage, 61 moderate damage, and 27 minor damage, while 90 sites remained intact, the ministry said in its report on cultural heritage sites.
The ministry accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting historical sites, which it described as fundamental to Palestinian national identity.
Israel launched a large-scale war against the Palestinian enclave on October 7, 2023, following a surprising Hamas attack on southern Israeli towns, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 people. The Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 47,000 Palestinians and caused extensive damage in the strip.
The UN estimates that the damaged buildings include more than 90 percent of the housing units in Gaza, with 160,000 destroyed and a further 276,000 severely or partially damaged. â–

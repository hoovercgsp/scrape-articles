DAMASCUS, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim authorities said they thwarted a planned bombing at a Shiite shrine south of Damascus, state news agency SANA reported on Saturday.
Citing an unnamed source in the General Intelligence Directorate, SANA said a group linked to the Islamic State (IS) had intended to attack the Sayyida Zainab shrine.
Security forces apprehended those involved before they could carry out the attack, which officials described as "a criminal act targeting the Syrian people," according to SANA.
No casualties or further details were immediately available. SANA did not say when the arrests took place or whether charges against the suspects had been filed.
The Sayyida Zainab shrine is a significant Shiite pilgrimage site. â–

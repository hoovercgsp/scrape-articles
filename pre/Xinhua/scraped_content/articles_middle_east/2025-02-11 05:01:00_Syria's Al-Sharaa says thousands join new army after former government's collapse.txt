DAMASCUS, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim President Ahmed Al-Sharaa said Monday that thousands of volunteers have joined the new Syrian army following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime and the dissolution of its military and security forces.
Speaking on a podcast, Al-Sharaa said the new government has opted for voluntary enlistment over conscription, noting that many young Syrians had previously fled to avoid forced service.
He also outlined Syria's political transition, stating that stabilizing institutions was the first priority after Assad's fall. The Idlib-based administration had prepared to assume control, and the new leadership was given a three-month mandate to consolidate power.
Al-Sharaa, appointed interim leader on Jan. 29, said his government is committed to free and fair elections and will soon issue a constitutional declaration to guide the transition. â–

DOHA, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire agreement after over 15 months of conflict. The devastating humanitarian crisis has resulted in the loss of more than 46,000 Palestinian lives and more than 1,200 Israelis, according to health authorities in Gaza and Israel.
The following is a timeline of major events since the conflict began in October 2023.
-- On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.
-- On Oct. 8, 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a "state of war" and vowed to dismantle Hamas, initiating widespread airstrikes on Gaza.
-- On Oct. 27, 2023, Israel launched a large-scale ground invasion into Gaza.
-- On Nov. 24-Dec. 1, 2023, a temporary four-day ceasefire brokered by Qatar and other mediators took effect, briefly pausing hostilities. The ceasefire was extended by two days, with another extension to Dec. 1. During this period, more than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza, while Israel released 240 Palestinian detainees. Israel's airstrikes on Gaza resumed on Dec. 2 after the ceasefire ended.

-- On Dec. 7, 2024, Qatar announced that momentum for renewed negotiations has returned, leading to the resumption of mediation efforts.

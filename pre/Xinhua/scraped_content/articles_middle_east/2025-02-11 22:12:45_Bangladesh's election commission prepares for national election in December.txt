DHAKA, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is preparing to hold the next general elections in December, Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah said after a meeting on Tuesday.
"The national election is our priority," he said, adding that if the government decides to hold local government elections before the national elections, the EC will implement that decision accordingly.
Chief Adviser of the Bangladeshi interim government Muhammad Yunus on Monday said the election roadmap will be discussed in a meeting of the Consensus Commission meeting on Saturday.
Yunus, an economist, took oath as the head of the country's interim government on Aug. 8 last year.
Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Aug. 6 last year, paving the way for the formation of the interim government following the resignation of then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. â–

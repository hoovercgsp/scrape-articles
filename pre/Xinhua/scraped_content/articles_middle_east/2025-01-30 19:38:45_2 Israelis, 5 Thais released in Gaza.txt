JERUSALEM/GAZA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military said two Israeli and five Thai hostages were handed over by Gaza militants to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Khan Younis camp in southern Gaza on Thursday.
The hostages are on their way to Israel, the Israeli military said in a statement.
Hamas has also confirmed the release of the seven hostages in separate statements, identifying the two Israeli ones as Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes.
Earlier in the day, the Israeli military said in a statement that an Israeli female soldier identified as Agam Berger, 20, was freed by Gaza militants, as a live broadcast showed her entering a Red Cross vehicle in Jabalia in northern Gaza.
Later on Thursday, Israel is expected to release another 110 Palestinian prisoners in the third exchange since a ceasefire in Gaza took effect last week. â–

TEHRAN, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's law enforcement has arrested a member of the Islamic State (ISIS) in the northern province of Mazandaran, according to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency.
The suspect was arrested in Juybar County during a joint operation by counterterrorism units from Mazandaran and the neighboring Golestan province, Tasnim reported, citing a statement from the Mazandaran law enforcement command center.
The arrest date was not specified. The detained has been handed over to judicial authorities.
Last October, three ISIS members were busted in Nowshahr County before they could carry out an attack on a popular tourist complex. â–

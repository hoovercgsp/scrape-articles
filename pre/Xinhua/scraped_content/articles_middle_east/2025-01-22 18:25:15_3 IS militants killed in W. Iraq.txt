BAGHDAD, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Three Islamic State (IS) militants, including a senior leader, were killed Wednesday in an operation in the western province of Anbar, the Iraqi military said.
Acting on intelligence reports and after seven days of surveillance, the Iraqi security force ambushed the militants in a desert area, killing the three militants and destroying their two vehicles, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
The statement noted that among the three, one is a senior IS leader who will be identified later.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

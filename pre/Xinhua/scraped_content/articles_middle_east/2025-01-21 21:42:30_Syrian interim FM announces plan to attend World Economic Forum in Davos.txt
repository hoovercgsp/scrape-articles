DAMASCUS, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim Foreign Minister, Asaad Hassan al-Shibani, announced Tuesday that he will represent his country for the first time at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2025.
"We will share Syria's developmental vision and the aspirations of our great people with the world," al-Shibani said on the social media platform X.
This marks the first time in Syria's history that its leadership has been invited to participate in the annual summit in Switzerland, a sign of Damascus's expanding international engagement following the recent change in government.
No additional details were provided regarding the Syrian delegation or the agenda for the global economic gathering.
However, the new administration has consistently emphasized reconstruction and development in its diplomatic efforts since assuming power late last year.
The World Economic Forum in Davos typically draws leaders in politics, business, and civil society to address global economic and social challenges. â–

BEIRUT, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The media offices of the Lebanese presidency and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on Wednesday dismissed media reports claiming that Lebanon and Israel had agreed to extend the ceasefire beyond Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, which falls at the end of March this year.
In an official statement, the presidential media office refuted the report, emphasizing that Lebanon had received no such information. "This news is false," the statement read, reaffirming President Joseph Aoun's stance on Israel's full withdrawal from Lebanese territory by the agreed deadline of Feb. 18.
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's office also denied the claims, calling them "entirely fabricated." It rejected assertions that Berri and Hezbollah had agreed to extend the ceasefire for a second time.
The U.S. and French-brokered ceasefire, in effect since Nov. 27, 2024, initially set a 60-day timeline for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territory. However, due to delays, the agreement was extended on Jan. 26 until Feb. 18 following a U.S. proposal.
As part of the ceasefire terms, the Lebanese army has been deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border and in southern Lebanon to uphold security and enforce the prohibition of weapons and armed groups south of the Litani River, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1701. â–

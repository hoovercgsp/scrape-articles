BEIRUT, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that the UN will exert all efforts to enable Lebanon to achieve economic recovery.
Guterres made his remarks upon his arrival at the Beirut airport.
"The UN will support all Lebanese sectors with its capabilities so that Lebanon can return to being a country of peace, beauty, and prosperity in the region," he said.
The UN chief said he visits Lebanon to express deep solidarity with the country and its people who have suffered from successive internal and regional crises.
Guterres also stressed that the UN Interim Force in Lebanon and its offices will continue to support Lebanon and its stability.
For his part, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, who greeted Guterres at the airport, said, "Lebanon is a peace-loving country committed to international laws and resolutions of international legitimacy. It appreciates the UN's constant support for its sovereignty and independence, and it relies on the UN's role to help the country overcome the economic crisis and rebuild what was destroyed by the Israeli strikes." â–

DUBAI, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center (ADSCC) has introduced a new approach to diabetes management using umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, the United Arab Emirates state news agency WAM reported on Thursday.
Mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to self-renew and can differentiate into a variety of cell types. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as umbilical cord.
The treatment was successfully administered to a 20-year-old Emirati patient with type 1 diabetes. Within a month, the patient's blood sugar levels showed significant improvement, and diabetes-related antibodies were reduced, with further progress anticipated, according to the report. The procedure involved a two-hour intravenous infusion carried out under strict medical protocols.
Maysoon Al Karam, chief medical officer at ADSCC, emphasized the therapy's potential to reduce insulin dependency. The patient's condition is being closely monitored through regular checkups.
Antonio Bencomo, general manager at ADSCC Research Center, stated that plans are underway to expand the therapy's application to patients with type 2 diabetes. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi held a phone conversation with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday, during which they discussed the latest developments in the Gaza Strip and the need for Gaza reconstruction without displacing its residents, according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency.
The two sides emphasized "the crucial need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement in its three stages, the exchange of hostages and detainees, as well as immediate and unfettered access to humanitarian aid in Gaza," the statement said.
Sisi and Frederiksen also stressed "the imperative to begin the reconstruction of Gaza to make it livable again, without displacing its Palestinian population, so as to safeguard their rights and ability to live on their land."
The talks reaffirmed the importance of establishing an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, highlighting it as "the only guarantee for achieving lasting peace, stability, and the desired economic prosperity."
The remarks came amid heightened concerns after U.S. President Donald Trump recently suggested redeveloping Gaza and relocating its population to neighboring countries including Egypt.
The controversial proposal has been widely rejected both regionally and internationally, with Egypt reiterating its opposition to any forced displacement of Palestinians.
Israel and Hamas have been implementing a ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States since January 19, following more than 15 months of deadly conflict in Gaza. â–

GAZA, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Monday, according to Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense.
An Israeli warplane struck Salah al-Din School east of Gaza City, killing five people and wounding dozens, Basal said. He added that another 30 people, including children, died in bombings targeting gatherings in the city.
Israeli aircraft also struck two gatherings in the Jabalia area in northern Gaza, killing five people and injuring 10 others, some critically, Basal said.
In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, an Israeli drone targeted a motorcycle, killing one person and wounding another, Basal added.
Civil defense crews recovered four bodies after an airstrike hit a civilian car north of Rafah in southern Gaza, he said, adding that "bombing and killing operations have not stopped since dawn."
The escalation comes as Israel and Hamas continue a deadly conflict that began on Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas launched a cross-border assault on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.
The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli strikes in Gaza has risen to 46,584, Gaza-based health authorities said on Monday. â–

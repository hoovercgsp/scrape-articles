RAMALLAH, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestine on Monday announced the end to the payments for "families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded," the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas "issued a decree law revoking the articles contained in the laws and regulations related to the system of paying financial allowances to the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded," WAFA said.
The decree cancels legislation that provided payments to Palestinian "security prisoners" based on the length of their sentences and to the families of militants killed while carrying out attacks, according to Israeli media. â–

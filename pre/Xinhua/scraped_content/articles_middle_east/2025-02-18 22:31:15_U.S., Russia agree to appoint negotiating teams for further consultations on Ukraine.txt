RIYADH, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Russian and U.S. delegations led by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, respectively, concluded in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday.
Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, described the Riyadh talks as "positive." He said, "It was a serious conversation on all issues," noting the two sides agreed to take into account each other's interests.
Both sides agreed to appoint high-level negotiating teams to work towards a settlement to the conflict in Ukraine "as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides," according to a statement by the U.S. Department of State.
Besides, they agreed to establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to the bilateral relationship to finally normalize the operation of the two countries' respective diplomatic missions, and to lay the groundwork for "future cooperation" between the two sides, said the U.S. statement. â–

BAGHDAD, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said on Tuesday that Iraq has achieved a 70 percent reduction in associated gas flaring.
Speaking at the "Iraq Energy Conference 2025" in Baghdad, al-Sudani outlined notable accomplishments of his government, which included "reducing gas flaring by 70 percent, leveraging oil wealth, investing in natural gas, and expanding oil derivatives production," according to a statement by al-Sudani's media office.
"Our priority was to stop gas flaring, and we have achieved 70 percent of this target," al-Sudani said. "This milestone significantly reduces emissions and energy waste."
He also noted that Iraq is nearing full self-sufficiency in fuels and is transitioning toward exporting diesel, aiming to convert 40 percent of its oil output into transformative industries by 2030.
Earlier in the month, al-Sudani said that Iraq has set a goal to achieve zero gas flaring by 2028.
Iraq has about 132 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, but it flares much of its gas wealth and relies on gas imports to feed its power plants. â–

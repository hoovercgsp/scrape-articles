GAZA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian man was killed and another seriously injured on Wednesday in an Israeli airstrike on a gathering of Palestinians in Rafah in southern Gaza, according to Palestinian and Israeli sources.
Local sources and eyewitnesses told Xinhua that an Israeli drone targeted a gathering of Palestinians while they were inspecting their homes east of Rafah.
Palestinian paramedics told Xinhua that medical crews transferred the body of a dead and a seriously injured to the European Gaza Hospital.
Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee confirmed the raid in a press statement, saying that "earlier today, an Air Force plane attacked a drone and two suspects while they were collecting it in the southern Gaza Strip."
"The raid was carried out after the drone was monitored crossing from Israeli territory to the southern Gaza Strip, where it was under surveillance throughout its flight path," said Adraee.
The Israeli spokesperson noted that Israel "will not allow any terrorist activity of any kind, and will continue to work as needed to maintain the security of the citizens of the State of Israel," indicating the Israeli army has recently monitored several attempts to smuggle combat equipment into Gaza using drones. â–

RAMALLAH, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Four Palestinians were killed on Saturday in two separate Israeli airstrikes on Jenin city in the northern West Bank, according to Palestinian sources.
Local sources and witnesses reported that an Israeli drone targeted a vehicle in the center of Qabatiya town south of Jenin.
Two Palestinian youths were killed in the strike on the vehicle, the Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed.
In response, the Israeli military said one of its air force drones, directed by the Shin Bet security service, targeted a vehicle carrying "terrorists" in Qabatiya as part of an operation in the northern West Bank.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said its teams transported the bodies of two victims and one injury from the eastern neighborhood of Jenin to the hospital following a bombardment in the area.
Palestinian security sources reported that the simultaneous Israeli airstrikes also targeted a motorcycle, leading to the deaths of another two young men.
The Israeli military did not issue an immediate comment on the bombing, which was the third strike on the city within a few hours.
These developments come as the Israeli military continues its operation in Jenin and its refugee camp for the 12th consecutive day, with explosions and destruction of residents' homes in the camp.
Israel and Hamas have reached a six-week ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Jan. 19. However, violence escalated in the West Bank with the raid in Jenin and a series of settler attacks on Palestinian villages.
The West Bank has witnessed escalating tensions since Oct. 7, 2023, which have resulted in the deaths of more than 800 Palestinians due to Israeli gunfire and airstrikes, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. â–

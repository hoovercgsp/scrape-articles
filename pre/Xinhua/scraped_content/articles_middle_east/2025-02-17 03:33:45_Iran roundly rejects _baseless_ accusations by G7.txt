TEHRAN, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei on Sunday completely rejected recent "baseless and irresponsible" accusations by the Group of Seven (G7) against Iran.
On Saturday, G7 foreign ministers and the EU high representative issued a statement following a meeting held on the margins of the Munich Security Conference, in which they accused Iran of carrying out "destabilizing actions, including its rapid advancement of uranium enrichment without credible civil justification, facilitation of terrorism organizations and armed groups across the Middle East and the Red Sea and violation of fundamental human rights."
They also denounced Iran's "proliferation of ballistic missiles and drones" in the statement.
The G7 countries' arms and financial support for Israel and their military and political interference in West Asia are the real "destabilizing" actions in the region, Baghaei said in a statement, urging those countries to stop their "meddlesome" policies so as to restore regional stability and security.
The Iranian government has "legitimate right and legal responsibility" to defend Iran's people, territorial integrity and national sovereignty against any threat and aggression, Baghaei said, stressing that expanding Iran's military and defensive capabilities based on international laws and regulations is necessary to those ends, and also to peace and security in West Asia.
Iran designed and is implementing peaceful nuclear activities according to its technical and industrial needs as well as international rights and obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said. â–

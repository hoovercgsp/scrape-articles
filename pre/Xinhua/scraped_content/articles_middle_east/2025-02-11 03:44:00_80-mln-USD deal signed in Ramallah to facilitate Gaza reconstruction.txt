RAMALLAH, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development Programme and the Arab and International Organization to Construct in Palestine on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) valued at 80 million U.S. dollars to facilitate rebuilding efforts in the Gaza Strip.
According to a statement by the Palestinian government, the MoU signed in Ramallah marks the first intervention of its kind since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which began last month.
It aims to assess damage, remove rubble from key areas, clear explosive remnants of war, and establish several temporary shelter centers equipped with essential infrastructure and services in the strip, said the statement.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said that the memorandum would bolster the government's on-the-ground efforts to urgently address the critical need for relief in Gaza.
He added that the Palestinian government has developed a six-month program to address the current situation in Gaza, along with a three-year plan to transition from relief to economic revitalization and early recovery, as well as a 10-year full-scale reconstruction program coordinated with the World Bank, the European Union, and the United Nations. â–

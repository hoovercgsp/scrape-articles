RAMALLAH, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a shooting attack at a checkpoint in the northern West Bank, which killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded eight others on Tuesday morning.
In a statement, the movement said, "We mourn our martyr Muhammad Daraghmeh from Tubas, who carried out the Tayasir operation yesterday morning."
The statement warned that continued escalation, raids, and settler attacks in the West Bank "will be met with more resistance strikes, which will not cease until the occupation is eradicated."
On Tuesday, the Israeli army announced that two of its soldiers had been killed and eight others injured -- two of them critically -- in an attack at the Tayasir checkpoint, east of Tubas in the northern West Bank.
On Jan. 21, the Israeli army launched a military operation named "Iron Wall" in Jenin and its refugee camp in the West Bank. The operation later expanded to other areas in the northern West Bank, with the Israeli military stating that its objective was to target armed militants and dismantle "terrorist infrastructure."
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, around 70 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the year. â–

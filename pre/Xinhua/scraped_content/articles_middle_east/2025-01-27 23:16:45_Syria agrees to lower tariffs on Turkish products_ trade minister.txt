ANKARA, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Syria has agreed to reduce customs duties on 269 products imported from Türkiye, according to Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat on Monday.
At a meeting to mark World Customs Day observed annually on Jan. 26, Bolat said the Turkish government "sent a technical team from customs and international agreements to Damascus" on Thursday.
"After the negotiations with the (Syrian) ministries of economy, customs, and trade, it was agreed to review the tariffs of some products in Syria," Bolat added.
The minister noted that the reduction of tariffs, effective as of this week, covers key Turkish exports to Syria, including eggs, flour, corn, milk, hygiene products, and certain iron and steel products.
Previously, the new Syrian authorities announced the implementation of uniform tariffs ranging from 300 percent to 500 percent at all border gates on the Syrian side, including imports from Türkiye, starting in January. ■

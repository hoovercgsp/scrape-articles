BEIRUT, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- In a remote field in southern Lebanon, 60-year-old farmer Salem Abdallah kneeled beside his cracked, dry soil, running his fingers through the dust. He looked up at the sky, searching for any sign of rain, but the clouds remained absent.
"This year, the earth has turned against us," he sighed, "At this point, all we can do is pray," he added.
Like thousands of farmers across Lebanon, Abdallah is facing one of the worst droughts in recent history. A severe lack of rainfall has caused groundwater levels in the war-torn country to plummet, springs to dry up, and crops to perish.
The severity of the drought is evident in the numbers. According to meteorological reports from Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport, rainfall levels this winter nearly halved compared to last year. Between Jan. 25 and Jan. 31, precipitation fell from 520 mm to just 242 mm in Beirut, from 540 mm to 247 mm in Tripoli, and from 285 mm to 149 mm in Zahle.
Lebanese geologist Jamal Khair explained that this isn't just bad luck -- it's climate change in action.
"The Earth's temperature has already exceeded 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels," he told Xinhua. "This leads to erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, and extreme heat waves. The lack of rain in Lebanon directly results from these global shifts."
For farmers like Abdallah, these statistics translate into real suffering.
"The cold usually kills insects and worms that harm crops. But without frost, these pests are multiplying, attacking fruit trees and plants at an alarming rate," Abdallah said.
Agricultural engineer Ghayath Hamdan warns that the drought is reducing crop yields and affecting crop quality. "Fruits and vegetables are smaller, weaker, and more susceptible to disease," he said. "Plants cannot grow properly without rain, and irrigation costs are skyrocketing."
Some farmers have turned to water tankers for irrigation, but the cost has become unbearable. "I now spend eight percent more on watering my land," said Omar Al-Khatib, a wheat farmer in the Bekaa Valley. "Many of us won't be able to afford this for long."
The situation is just as dire for those who depend on Lebanon's longest and most vital river, the Litani.
Standing on the riverbank, farmer Talal Abu Fares looks at what used to be a strong, flowing current. "The Litani has turned into a mere stream," he said. "If this continues, we will lose everything: Our crops, livestock, even our ability to live here," he complained.
Sami Alawieh, director general of the National Authority of the Litani River, has confirmed the severity of the crisis. "The water level in Qaraoun Lake has dropped to half its total capacity," he said. "This affects not only irrigation but also hydroelectric power production, worsening Lebanon's energy crisis."
Beyond the fields and rivers, the drought is hitting Lebanese households. Water authorities have already begun strict rationing, urging residents to conserve water as much as possible.
"People forget that drought doesn't just affect farmers," said Hamdan. "It affects all of us, our drinking water, sanitation, even our daily lives."
With no immediate foreseeable solution, Lebanese farmers and experts are calling for urgent action.
On Jan. 23, Lebanon's caretaker Agriculture Minister Abbas Hajj Hassan launched the country's first-ever National Drought Management Plan in collaboration with the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development.
"This plan is a milestone for Lebanon, as it is one of the last Arab countries to develop a drought response strategy," said Hajj Hassan.
The minister emphasized that the plan aims to mitigate the drought's economic and environmental impact while strengthening cooperation with Arab and regional partners.
"Joint Arab action is crucial in addressing climate challenge and ensuring food security," he said, highlighting the importance of sustainable solutions to Lebanon's growing water crisis. â–

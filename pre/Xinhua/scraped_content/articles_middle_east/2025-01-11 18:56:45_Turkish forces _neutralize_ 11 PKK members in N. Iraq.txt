ANKARA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye has "neutralized" 11 members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in a cross-border operation in northern Iraq, the Turkish Defense Ministry announced on Saturday.
The PKK members were killed in Hakurk, Metina, and Gara regions, the ministry said in a statement, without specifying the date of the operation.
"We are determined to eliminate terrorism at its source," the ministry stressed.
Turkish authorities often use the term "neutralize" in their statements to imply the alleged "terrorists" have either surrendered, been captured, or been killed.
The PKK, which is designated a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States, and the European Union, has been rebelling against the Turkish government for over three decades.
Turkish security forces frequently conduct cross-border operations in northern Iraq, targeting PKK hideouts and bases. ■

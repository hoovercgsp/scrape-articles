CAIRO, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim affirmed Friday the two countries' rejection of the displacement of Palestinians from their land, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement.
In a phone conversation, the two sides discussed the situation in Palestinian territories, stressing the need to intensify international efforts to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, which they said is the only guarantee for achieving permanent peace in the region.
They also reviewed Egypt's efforts to implement the Gaza ceasefire agreement in cooperation with Qatar and the United States and deliver humanitarian aid to the strip.
Anwar, for his part, praised Egypt's role in supporting the Palestinians, stopping the bloodshed, and restoring calm to the region.
Citing an Egyptian official source, Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported on Friday that Egypt has provided nearly 70 percent of the humanitarian aid delivered to Gaza, "without collecting any fees." â–

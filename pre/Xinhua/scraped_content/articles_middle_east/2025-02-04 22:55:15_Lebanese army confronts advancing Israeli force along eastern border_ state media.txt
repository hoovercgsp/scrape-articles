BEIRUT, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army confronted an Israeli armored force that attempted to advance into its eastern border villages on Tuesday, according to eyewitnesses and official Lebanese military sources.
The state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that the Israeli unit, consisting of six armored vehicles, crossed the demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel in the occupied Shebaa Farms sector, advancing towards the village of Kfarchouba and reaching the outskirts of Kfarhamam while firing heavy machine-gun rounds. The force withdrew approximately two hours later, NNA said.
The Lebanese army said in a statement that its units deployed in the village of Taybeh, in the eastern sector, and other border areas south of the Litani River following the incursion.
Also on Tuesday, Lebanon's Foreign Ministry filed a complaint with the UN Security Council, condemning Israel's violations of Resolution 1701 and the cessation of hostilities.
The ministry said in a statement that Israel had "completely disregarded" its commitments under the resolution's enhanced security arrangements. It urged increased support for the Lebanese army and UNIFIL to protect Lebanese sovereignty and the safety of its citizens.
The ministry's statement said Israeli violations, including continued ground and air assaults, destruction of homes, and attacks on Lebanese citizens, had resulted in the deaths of approximately 24 civilians and injuries to more than 124 others. â–

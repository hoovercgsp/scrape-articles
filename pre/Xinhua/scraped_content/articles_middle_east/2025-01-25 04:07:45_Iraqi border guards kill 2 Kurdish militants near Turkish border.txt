BAGHDAD, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Border Guards Command said on Friday that it had killed two militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) near the Iraqi-Turkish border in response to the group's earlier attack.
In a statement, the command said that it had dispatched reinforcements to the scene and killed two PKK militants after cordoning off the area in search of the attackers.
Earlier in the day, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said that PKK militants opened fire on the Iraqi border guards who were tasked with securing the Iraqi-Turkish border area near the town of Zakho in Duhok province, killing two border guards and wounding one.
Iraq considers the PKK a banned organization and does not allow it to operate on its territory.
The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Türkiye, and its presence in northern Iraq, particularly in the Kurdistan Region, has been a source of tension between Iraq, Türkiye, and the Kurdish authorities in Iraq. ■

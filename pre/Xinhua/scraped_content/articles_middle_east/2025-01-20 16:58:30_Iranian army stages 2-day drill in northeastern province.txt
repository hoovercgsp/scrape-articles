TEHRAN, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian army's ground force launched a two-day military drill on Sunday in the northeastern Khorasan Razavi province, said local authorities.
The exercise aims to enhance the troops' combat capabilities and showcase the Iranian armed forces' new weapons and gears, according to a press release from the army's public relations on Monday.
The first stage of the exercise, involving artillery, armored, airborne, drone, electronic warfare and missile units, began in Torbat-e Jam County on Sunday night, it said.
In the first phase of the "offensive-security" drill, the ground force's special rapid reaction units practiced capturing mock terrorist leaders and senior members before they could enter the country, carrying out specialized operations with drones, missiles, bombs, helicopters and armored vehicles, it added.
The Iranian armed forces have conducted several drills over the past few days and plan to hold more during the coming weeks to maintain and enhance their military preparedness against potential threats. â–

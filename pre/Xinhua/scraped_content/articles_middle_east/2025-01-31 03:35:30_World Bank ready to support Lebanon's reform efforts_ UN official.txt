BEIRUT, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is prepared to assist Lebanon in implementing necessary reforms, said UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon Imran Riza during a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on Thursday.
Riza conveyed the UN's readiness to support Lebanon in enacting reforms and securing financial assistance.
For his part, Aoun emphasized that reforms will be a top priority for the new Lebanese government once formed, as Lebanon remains committed to achieving economic and institutional recovery.
He also stressed Lebanon's willingness to cooperate with UN organizations to advance these efforts.
The meeting also addressed the damages caused by the recent Israeli offensive on Lebanon.
Riza noted that an emergency loan of 250 million U.S. dollars could be secured based on a UN assessment of the destruction. â–

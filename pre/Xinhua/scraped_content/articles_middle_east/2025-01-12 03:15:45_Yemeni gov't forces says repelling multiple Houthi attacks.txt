ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni government forces said on Saturday that they repelled several Houthi attacks across multiple fronts, inflicting "significant casualties and material losses on the militant group."
Yemen's Ministry of Defense said in a statement that the government forces "successfully countered and aborted multiple Houthi offensives in Marib, Al-Jawf, and Taiz provinces over the past 24 hours."
In Marib, military forces defended against attacks on the northwestern front, where Houthi militants employed artillery, snipers, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
A local military official confirmed that "several people were killed from both warring factions during the past 24 hours as a result of the sporadic fighting taking place in various Yemeni regions."
Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war between government forces and the Houthi group since late 2014. â–

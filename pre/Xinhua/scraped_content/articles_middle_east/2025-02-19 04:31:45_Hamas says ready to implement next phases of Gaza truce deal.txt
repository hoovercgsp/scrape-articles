GAZA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Hamas reaffirmed on Tuesday its willingness to implement the second and third phases of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in a statement that the group had agreed, at the request of a mediator, to double the number of Israeli hostages to be released, demonstrating its commitment to the deal.
Qassem rejected Israeli demands for Hamas to leave Gaza, calling them part of a "psychological war." He stressed that Hamas would not accept Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that the group disarm and its leaders be expelled from Gaza.
Separately, Israel's public broadcaster reported that Netanyahu had officially decided to begin negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal and informed the Security Cabinet of his decision. â–

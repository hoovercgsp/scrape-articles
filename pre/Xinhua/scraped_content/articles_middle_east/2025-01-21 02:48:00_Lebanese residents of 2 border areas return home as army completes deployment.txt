BEIRUT, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the southern Lebanese border town of Bint Jbeil and the nearby village of Ainata have begun to return home, a Lebanese security source said on Monday.
The return followed the completion of Lebanese Army deployments in the two areas, which the five-member committee -- comprising the U.S., France, Lebanon, Israel, and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) -- overseeing the ceasefire agreement has declared safe.
The official National News Agency (NNA) reported that a military convoy of Lebanese Army M113 troop carriers entered Bint Jbeil, as part of the redeployment plan in the border region.
NNA reporters, who observed the situation in Bint Jbeil while enemy drones remained overhead, noted the return of local residents inspecting the damage to their properties and livelihoods. Despite the widespread devastation, many expressed joy at returning to their town and vowed to begin reconstruction efforts immediately.
The Lebanese Army Command issued a statement confirming the completion of the army's deployment in Ain Ebel, Debel, Rmeish, Bint Jbeil, and Ainata, following the withdrawal of Israeli forces. This operation was conducted in coordination with the UNIFIL and the five-member ceasefire committee.
The statement noted that specialized units are conducting engineering surveys, clearing roads, removing rubble, and dealing with unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials left behind by Israeli forces.
These developments followed the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024, ending nearly 14 months of fighting between the two sides. The agreement mandates Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territory within 60 days, with the Lebanese Army assuming security control along the Lebanese-Israeli border and in the southern region, ensuring the area south of the Litani River remains free of weapons and militants. â–

BEIRUT, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on Monday urged the swift formation of a government capable of meeting the aspirations of the Lebanese people, according to a statement from the Lebanese Presidency.
"We must send positive signals to the international community by forming a government that aligns with the hopes of the Lebanese people and enables the country's economic recovery," Aoun said in a meeting with religious leaders. "Lebanon must be placed back on the right path."
"We have a choice -- either to seize these opportunities and rebuild the nation with unity and clear intentions or to risk further decline. The international community has extended positive gestures and invitations, and we must reciprocate," he said.
Aoun stressed that rebuilding Lebanon requires collective efforts from all political factions, civil society, and religious leaders.
He also urged an end to blame-shifting, emphasizing that responsibility for Lebanon's revival lies within the country.
"When we form a government and start working in the public interest, many nations will be willing to support us," he added.
On Jan. 9, Aoun was elected the new president of Lebanon, ending a two-year presidential vacuum that had paralyzed the country's political system. He then named Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as the new prime minister. â–

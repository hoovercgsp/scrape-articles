GAZA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hamas condemned on Saturday the remarks of U.S. President Donald Trump on relocating Gazan residents to neighboring Egypt and Jordan.
In a press statement, Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri denounced such proposals as "ridiculous and worthless," saying that "what the Israeli occupation failed to achieve by force, will not be obtained through political games."
"The repeated U.S. announcements on displacing Palestinians under the pretext of rebuilding the Gaza Strip represents the country's complicity in the crime," said Abu Zuhri.
He warned that the U.S. "displacement projects" are a recipe for more chaos and tension in the region.
On Jan. 25, Trump proposed a controversial plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, which was strongly rejected by both countries. â–

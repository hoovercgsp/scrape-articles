BAGHDAD, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Four Islamic State (IS) militants were killed on Friday in airstrikes on their hideout in central Iraq, the Iraqi military said.
Acting on intelligence reports, Iraqi forces spotted four IS militants in the Zarga area, a rugged area between the provinces of Salahudin and Kirkuk, and killed them all in two airstrikes on their hideout, according to a statement from the Security Media Cell, a media outlet affiliated with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command.
The security situation in Iraq has improved since the defeat of the IS in 2017. However, IS remnants have sneaked into urban centers, deserts, and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerrilla attacks against security forces and civilians. â–

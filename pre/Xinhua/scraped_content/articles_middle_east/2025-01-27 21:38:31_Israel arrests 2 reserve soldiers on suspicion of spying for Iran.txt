JERUSALEM, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Police said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested two 21-year-old Israeli reserve soldiers on suspicion of security offenses related to Iran, in collaboration with the Israel Security Agency.
According to the police, the two, Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev from northern Israel, are suspected of transferring classified information about the Israeli Iron Dome air defense system to Iran.
The police added that during their regular and reserve military service, the two carried out missions for an Iranian operator, including filming a video of the air defense system, spraying graffiti in Tel Aviv and northern Israel, and hanging posters.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV News reported that the suspects received a few thousand U.S. dollars from the Iranian operator for their actions.
The police noted that the two admitted their actions and will be charged with aiding the enemy in war, which is punishable by life imprisonment or death, contacting a foreign agent, and passing classified information to a foreign agent. â–

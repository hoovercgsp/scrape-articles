RIYADH, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Sunday for his first official visit abroad, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
He was received at the airport by Deputy Governor of Riyadh Region, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz, and several other officials,
During his visit, al-Sharaa is scheduled to hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud and other Saudi officials to discuss topics related to Syria and regional affairs, the SPA added.
Al-Sharaa, 43, has led HTS since 2017 and played a key role in the offensive that led to the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024 and the establishment of the Syrian transitional government. He has been the country's de facto leader since Assad's ouster.
Syria's Military Operations Administration announced on Jan. 29 the appointment of al-Sharaa as president during the transitional period, granting him authority to establish an interim legislative council until a permanent constitution is ratified. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt announced on Sunday that Cairo will host an emergency Arab summit on Feb. 27 to address the latest developments concerning the Palestinian issue and the Gaza Strip, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The summit was decided to be held after Egypt's high-level consultations with Arab nations, including Palestine, which requested the summit, and coordination with Bahrain, the current chair of the Arab League (AL) summit and the AL secretariat, according to the statement.
The announcement followed controversial remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, including Egypt and Jordan. The proposal has been widely rejected both regionally and internationally.
During a joint press conference in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump stated that the United States planned to assume control of Gaza and redevelop it after relocating its Palestinian residents.
Trump has previously floated similar proposals, which both Egypt and Jordan have explicitly rejected, reaffirming their opposition to any forced displacement of Palestinians. â–

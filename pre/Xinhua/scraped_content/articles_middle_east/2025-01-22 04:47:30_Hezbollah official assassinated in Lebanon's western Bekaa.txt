BEIRUT, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Hammadi, a senior Hezbollah official, was assassinated on Tuesday afternoon in Lebanon's Western Bekaa region, according to a source in the Lebanese Internal Security Forces.
The source told Xinhua that "unidentified gunmen, traveling in two vehicles, opened fire at Sheikh Mohammed Hammadi while he was standing outside his home in the town of Machghara, eastern Lebanon."
Hammadi sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to a hospital in the nearby town of Sohmor, where he succumbed to his injuries, the source added.
In response, Lebanese army units swiftly cordoned off Machghara, setting up fixed and mobile checkpoints across towns in Western Bekaa and launching a wide-scale manhunt for the assailants.
Hezbollah has yet to issue an official statement regarding the assassination.
According to security sources, Machghara, located in Lebanon's Western Bekaa, still suffered from Israeli airstrikes despite the ceasefire agreement. â–

ANKARA, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye is working on expanding electricity exports to Syria, including the Aleppo city and other regions, said a cabinet minister.
Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar told local CnnTurk broadcaster late Thursday that Türkiye currently supplies 210 megawatts of electricity daily to Syria through seven transmission points.
"We aim to increase this to 300 megawatts by February to better support areas such as Idlib and Afrin," he said, predicting that electricity exports to Aleppo could reach 500 megawatts within six months to ease energy challenges.
Bayraktar noted the existing infrastructure linking Türkiye to Aleppo, and its potential for revitalization to address future energy needs.
Türkiye also plans to supply natural gas from the Turkish province of Kilis to the Syrian city of Aleppo via a new pipeline, which is expected to be operational within a year, to boost electricity production and distribution, said the minister.
With these efforts, Türkiye moves to support short-term recovery in Syria while building a foundation for longer-term energy cooperation, he said, adding that a Turkish delegation has visited Syria to assess the country's energy infrastructure. ■

RAMALLAH, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, held a phone conversation on Sunday, during which the two sides reaffirmed their support for the two-state solution.
Abbas reiterated his absolute rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, which "violate international legitimacy resolutions and international law," and "undermine the two-state solution and opportunities for peace, security and stability in the region," the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
The two also discussed the latest developments in Palestinian territories, highlighted the urgent need for humanitarian aid, and stressed the importance of upholding the Gaza ceasefire agreement, ensuring the Palestinian Authority assume responsibility in Gaza, advancing implementing the two-state solution based on international legitimacy, and rebuilding Gaza with Palestinians remaining on their land, among others, WAFA reported.
Abbas briefed Macron on the ongoing preparations for the upcoming Emergency Arab Summit on the Palestinian issue, hosted by Egypt, WAFA reported.
"I reiterated my satisfaction at seeing the first phase of the ceasefire being respected," Macron wrote on social media platform X following the phone conversation.
He said France is working with regional and global partners towards "a clear objective: defining a credible roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution -- the only way to ensure peace and security for all in the region." â–

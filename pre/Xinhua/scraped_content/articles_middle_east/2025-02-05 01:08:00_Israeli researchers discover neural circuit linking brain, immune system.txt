JERUSALEM, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have identified a neural circuit that enables the brain to regulate immune system activity through associative learning.
The study, led by the University of Haifa (UH) and published recently in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveals how the brain and immune system collaborate to prepare for future challenges, according to a statement released Tuesday by the UH.
The findings show that both "learn" to activate the immune response based on sensory information and brain activity, particularly taste associations, the statement said, adding that the interaction between the two occurs in the brain's insula, where sensory and immune representations meet.
According to the statement, the study is the first to identify the specific nerve cells and pathways that integrate sensory and immune information.
It suggests many illnesses stem from immune system impairments and proposes new therapeutic approaches that integrate brain activity, behavior, and immune function to improve disease treatment, said the statement. â–

GAZA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, including a child, in southern Gaza on Wednesday despite a 17-day-old ceasefire, medical officials told Xinhua.
Paramedics said that a child, identified as Hamza Al-Hamas, was killed by Israeli gunfire in Rafah. Earlier, Oday Al-Dabari, a young man, was fatally shot east of Khan Younis.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incidents but has previously said it opens fire on Palestinians deemed threats to its troops, even during truces.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 12 more Palestinians died in the past 24 hours, including eight bodies recovered from rubble and four who succumbed to wounds, with 11 others injured. The total death toll since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, now stands at 47,552, with 111,629 wounded. Rescue operations remain hampered by blocked access to debris-strewn areas.
Israel's military campaign in Gaza began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and seized roughly 250 hostages.
A ceasefire deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States took effect on Jan. 15, 2025, aiming to stabilize the region and lay the groundwork for a permanent truce. The phased agreement stipulates Hamas releasing 33 Israeli hostages in the first 42 days in exchange for Israel freeing over 1,890 Palestinian prisoners. â–

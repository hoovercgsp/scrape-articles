TEHRAN, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran delivered 1,000 domestically-produced drones to its army on Monday, state news agency IRNA reported.
The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), designed and manufactured by the Defense Ministry, were distributed to combat units across various regions of the country, the report said.
At a handover ceremony, Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said the drones would strengthen Iran's ability to "dominate the skies and deliver decisive blows to its enemies when necessary."
The UAVs have an operational range exceeding 2,000 km and are equipped with advanced features, including high destructive power, low radar detectability, and autonomous operation without external control, IRNA said.
The drones are intended for special missions and are expected to enhance the military's capabilities in reconnaissance, border surveillance, and combat, the report added. â–

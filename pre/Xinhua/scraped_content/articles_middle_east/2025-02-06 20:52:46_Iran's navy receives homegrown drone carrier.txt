TEHRAN, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Navy of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Thursday took delivery of the homegrown "Shahid Bagheri" drone carrier, the official news agency IRNA reported.
According to the report, the ship was delivered to the IRGC Navy's combat fleet off the coast of the southern port city of Bandar Abbas.

The 240-meter-long and 21-meter-high drone carrier has a 180-meter runway and can carry up to 60 drones and 30 missile-launching vessels with missiles' operation ranges from 750 to 2,000 km. Its sailing range exceeds 19,000 nautical miles, and a squadron can be stationed aboard.

GAZA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded on Saturday in Israeli airstrikes on various areas of the Gaza Strip.
Eight Palestinians, including two children and two women, were killed, and more than 30 people, including 19 children, were wounded in an Israeli bombing on a school housing displaced people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told Xinhua.
In another attack, two Palestinians were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a house in the Shujaiya neighborhood east of Gaza City, according to Basal.
Three others, including a woman and a child, were killed and 10 wounded in a bombing that targeted an apartment in a residential building in the al-Rimal neighborhood, west of Gaza City.
In the east of Gaza City, an airstrike on a gathering of citizens in al-Nafaq Street killed four people, said Basal.
Three were killed by Israeli warplanes bombing a tent in the city of Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, Basal added.
Meanwhile, Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a press statement that its air force planes attacked Hamas "terrorists" who operated inside a command and control complex in an area previously used as a school in Jabalia.
Adraee added that Hamas members used the complex to plan and carry out attacks against Israel.
Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostages.
The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip has risen to 46,537, the Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Saturday. â–

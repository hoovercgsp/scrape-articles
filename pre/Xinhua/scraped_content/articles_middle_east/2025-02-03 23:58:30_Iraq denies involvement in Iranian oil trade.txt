BAGHDAD, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq denied on Monday its involvement in purchasing, receiving, or re-exporting Iranian crude oil to help Iran "evade sanctions," emphasizing that its export operations are subject to strict controls.
All quantities of Iraqi crude oil are exported in accordance with international mechanisms and standards that ensure the highest level of transparency, according to a statement issued by the State Organization for Marketing of Oil, a state-owned company affiliated with the Iraqi Oil Ministry.
The company, responsible for marketing Iraq's oil, confirmed that it didn't deal with any companies or tankers subject to international sanctions, pledging to announce the names of all tankers transporting petroleum products from Iraqi ports to enhance transparency. â–

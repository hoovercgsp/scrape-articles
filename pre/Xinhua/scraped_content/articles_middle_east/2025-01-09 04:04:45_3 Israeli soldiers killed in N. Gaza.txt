JERUSALEM, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military announced on Wednesday that three of its soldiers were killed and an officer seriously injured during a raid in the northern Gaza Strip.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV reported that the soldiers were killed when their tank ran over powerful explosive devices in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza.
The three soldiers from the Iron Trails Brigade's 46th Armored Battalion "fell during combat," said the military in a statement.
Two soldiers were identified as Matityahu Ya'akov Perel, 22, from the West Bank settlement of Beit El, and Kanaoo Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, a city west of Jerusalem. The army did not disclose the third soldier's name, as the family has yet to be notified.
The latest deaths bring the total number of Israeli soldiers killed to 831 since the beginning of the country's multi-front war in October 2023.
According to Gaza-based health authorities, Israeli strikes have killed 45,936 people and injured 109,274 others in the Palestinian enclave. â–

AMMAN, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Monday said no solution to the Palestinian issue will come at the expense of Jordan or the Palestinians' rights to their land, freedom, sovereignty, and dignity.
"No to an alternative homeland. No to any attempt to diminish the rights of the Palestinian people and no to their displacement. This is not only because it is a long-standing, unwavering Jordanian position, but also because any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land will only undermine security and stability," Safadi said during a lower house session, according to a statement by his ministry.
The minister added that Jordan continues to exert every possible effort to revive a politically effective movement to realize an independent, sovereign Palestinian state on Palestinian national soil, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the two-state solution.
"Our coordination with our brothers in Palestine and other Arab states is ongoing, and we are in full agreement about all positions. Our starting point is the solution that realizes an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil," he said.
Safadi noted that the priority at the current stage is to stabilize the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, provide urgent and sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza residents, and initiate the reconstruction process in the enclave.
He said any talk of an alternative homeland for Palestinians is rejected. "We do not accept it, have not accepted it, and will continue to oppose it with all our capabilities," Safadi said.
The minister's remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed on Saturday to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan. â–

BEIRUT, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Aoun, Lebanon's former army chief, was elected the 14th president of Lebanon on Thursday, ending a two-year presidential vacuum that had paralyzed the country's political system.
Aoun secured the presidency during the second round of voting, garnering 99 out of 128 parliamentary votes. This development comes after a protracted political stalemate, which left the presidential seat vacant following the conclusion of former President Michel Aoun's term in October 2022. Since then, the Lebanese parliament has failed to elect a successor in 12 electoral sessions due to bitter political division, leaving the country under the administration of a caretaker government.
According to political analysts, Aoun's election would restore the functionality of Lebanon's public institutions, promote stability and prosperity, and revive the country's regional and international standing, opening a new chapter for Lebanon.
FROM MILITARY COMMANDER TO NATIONAL LEADER
Aoun, born in 1964 in a suburb of Beirut, hails from a Christian community. He joined the army in 1983 and rose steadily through the ranks, becoming commander-in-chief in 2017. He had been slated to retire in January 2024, but his term was extended twice during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict which began in October 2023.
As army chief, Aoun earned widespread respect for his leadership during Lebanon's prolonged economic crisis, which has severely impacted the armed forces. Despite slashed salaries and shortages in basic provisions, Aoun managed to maintain the military's operational capacity, which bolstered public trust in the army and enhanced his reputation.
Aoun also played a pivotal role in enforcing the ceasefire agreement reached with Israel on Nov. 27, 2024. Under his command, the army deployed troops along the southern border to ensure the implementation of the deal, helping Lebanon navigate a tense and volatile regional environment.
END OF POLITICAL PARALYSIS
Lebanon endured more than two years of political gridlock after the end of the former president's term in October 2022. Lebanon's parliament held multiple voting sessions, but deep divisions among political factions repeatedly blocked the election of a new president.
This deadlock was finally broken due to mounting domestic and international pressures. Political paralysis becomes increasingly unsustainable as Lebanon is battered by deepening economic woes and growing social unrest. Political factions began to realize the urgency of electing a president. Simultaneously, the international community intensified its diplomatic efforts to push Lebanese leaders toward consensus.
Experts have said that Aoun's election reflects shifts within Lebanon's political landscape.
Sami Nader, director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs in Lebanon, told Xinhua that Hezbollah's influence has declined following its recent conflict with Israel and amid internal and external challenges.
"This weakening, along with adjustments by and support from external actors, has gradually shifted Lebanon's political dynamics, creating conditions to break the presidential deadlock," Nader explained.
HOPES FOR STABILITY
Aoun's election is seen as a turning point for Lebanon, potentially paving the way for the restoration of political stability and institutional functionality, experts have said. They noted Aoun's military background and personal reputation have raised hopes that he could provide the decisive leadership required to address Lebanon's multifaceted crises.
Describing the election as a "long-awaited step crucial to rebuilding the state," Nader highlighted that Aoun's military experience enables a more resolute leadership approach, expected to help restore security and order in Lebanon, boosting public confidence in the government.
Echoing Nader's viewpoint, Refaat Badawi, a Lebanese political researcher and consultant, told Xinhua that Aoun's election would not only reshape Lebanon's international image but also lay the groundwork for restoring the functionality of state institutions and revitalizing Lebanon's relationships with regional and international partners.
A functioning presidency could facilitate the formation of an effective cabinet capable of implementing crucial reforms and unlocking financial support from donor countries, which is "essential" for the crisis-stricken country, Badawi remarked.
Aoun's election occurs during a critical period as Lebanon emerges from 14 months of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. In his first remarks as president, Aoun pledged to strengthen the army, secure the southern border, uphold international resolutions, and develop a comprehensive defense strategy to prevent threats.
Nevertheless, the challenges ahead are daunting. Aoun must also tackle endemic corruption, address Lebanon's sectarian divisions, and balance relations with regional powers while avoiding entanglement in external conflicts, experts noted. â–

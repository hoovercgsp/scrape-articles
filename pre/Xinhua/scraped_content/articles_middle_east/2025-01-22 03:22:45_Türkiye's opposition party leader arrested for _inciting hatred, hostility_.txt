ISTANBUL, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Umit Ozdag, chairman of Türkiye's opposition Victory Party, was arrested on Tuesday in connection with an ongoing investigation on "openly inciting the public to hatred and hostility."
The state-run Anadolu agency reported that Ozdag was arrested and sent to Metris Prison in Istanbul after completing legal procedures at the Istanbul Courthouse.
On Sunday, an investigation was launched against Ozdag for his remarks about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a party meeting under the charge of "insulting the president."
It was later expanded to include the charge of "inciting the public to hatred and hostility," Anadolu reported.
According to Victory Party spokesperson Azmi Karamahmutoglu, Ozdag was released from the first charge but was referred to court with a request for arrest on the second charge. ■

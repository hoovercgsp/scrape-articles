BAGHDAD, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi border guards were killed and one wounded on Friday in an attack by PKK militants near the Iraqi-Turkish border in Iraq's semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said in a statement.
The attack occurred when PKK militants opened fire on the Iraqi border guards who were tasked with securing the Iraqi-Turkish border area near the town of Zakho in Duhok province, the statement said.
Iraq considers the PKK a banned organization and does not allow it to operate on its territory.
Turkish forces frequently carry out cross-border operations targeting PKK militants in northern Iraq, with a particular focus on the Qandil Mountains, a stronghold of the group.
The PKK, designated as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States, and the European Union, has rebelled against the Turkish government for more than three decades. ■

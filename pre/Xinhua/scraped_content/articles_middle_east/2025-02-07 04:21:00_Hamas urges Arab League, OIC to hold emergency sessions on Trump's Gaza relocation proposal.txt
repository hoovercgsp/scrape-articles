GAZA, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Hamas on Thursday called on the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to convene emergency sessions to address U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, urging for a strong, unified stance against these plans.
In a press release, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi called for coordinated diplomatic efforts at both the Arab and international levels, emphasizing the need for a united Palestinian stance against any proposals that undermine their rights or aim to displace them from their land.
He also called for strengthening Palestinian unity and forming a unified front to develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing the threats to Gaza and Palestine as a whole, emphasizing that the response should involve a coordination of political, diplomatic, and practical measures.
The Hamas leader also strongly rejected Trump's proposals, describing them as "racist" and a continuation of settlement policies aimed at undermining the Palestinian cause, striping Palestinians of their rights, and displacing them from their homeland.
"Our Palestinian people -- whether in Gaza, the West Bank, Jerusalem, or within Israel -- will never give up their rights or allow themselves to be displaced. Trump's remarks are just another illusion from an American administration that favors the occupation, and this scheme will collapse as all previous ones," he said. â–

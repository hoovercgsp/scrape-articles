ISTANBUL, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- China has been selected as the "focus country" for the 10th Istanbul Publishing Fellowship (IPF), set to take place from Feb. 25 to 27, the Turkish Publishers Association announced on Tuesday.
In a press conference held here, Muhammed Agirakca, chairman of the IPF's organization committee, explained that China was chosen due to its rich literary traditions and the growing importance of cultural exchange between China and Türkiye.
He emphasized the significance of fostering stronger ties between the two nations through their shared cultural and literary heritage.
"As publishers, we are eagerly envisioning the books we will translate for one another," Agirakca remarked. "We will witness the birth stories of several works at the Istanbul Publishing Fellowship, and many of our publishers have been preparing for this."
According to Agirakca, during the event, a vibrant array of Chinese-themed stands will immerse attendees in a rich cultural experience, featuring both traditional and modern Chinese art, food, and performances through interactive displays.
The event will also provide exclusive sessions and networking opportunities, allowing participants to engage in one-on-one meetings with Chinese representatives, further enhancing cultural exchange and collaboration within the publishing industry.
This year's program is expected to attract 378 publishers from 75 countries, including 120 Turkish publishers, according to the IPF's organization committee. ■

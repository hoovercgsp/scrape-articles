RIYADH, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers and senior diplomats from regional and Western countries convened here on Sunday to discuss coordinated efforts to support Syria.
The meeting, chaired by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, focused on the lifting of sanctions on Syria, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
The United States, Britain, the European Union, and others have imposed harsh sanctions on Syria since the onset of the Syrian civil war in 2011.
Following the overthrow of former President Bashar al-Assad's government on Dec. 8, 2024, the United States on Monday issued a six-month exemption from its sanctions for transactions with Syrian governing bodies, aiming to facilitate humanitarian assistance and allow some energy-related transactions.
During Sunday's meeting, the Saudi foreign minister welcomed the U.S. decision and urged other countries and concerned parties to follow suit.
He also called for providing all forms of support and assistance in rebuilding Syria and creating a favorable environment for the return of Syrian refugees.
At the one-day meeting, participants from countries including Türkiye, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Britain, Germany, the United States, and Italy expressed support for Syria's political transition.
The meeting concluded with a statement affirming a consensus on the need to assist the Syrian people in rebuilding a united, independent, and secure country, free from terrorism and violations of sovereignty. ■

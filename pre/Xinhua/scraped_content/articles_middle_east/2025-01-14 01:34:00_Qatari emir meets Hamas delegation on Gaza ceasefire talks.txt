DOHA, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani met here on Monday with a Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya, a member of Hamas' political bureau, according to a statement from the Emiri Diwan, the administrative office of the emir.
The two sides have held discussions focusing on the ongoing Gaza ceasefire negotiations and efforts to secure a long-term truce in the Palestinian enclave, said the statement.
The meeting took place as a senior Hamas official said earlier in the day that the group has delivered a "positive" response to a draft of the Gaza ceasefire deal offered by mediators in the Qatari capital Doha.
During the meeting, the emir also reaffirmed Qatar's unwavering stance on the Palestinian cause and its firm support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to establish an independent state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. â–

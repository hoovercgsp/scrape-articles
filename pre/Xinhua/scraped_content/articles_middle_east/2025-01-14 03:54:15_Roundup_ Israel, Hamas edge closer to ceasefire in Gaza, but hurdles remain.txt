JERUSALEM, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- While obstacles persist, Israel and Hamas appeared to move closer on Monday to a potential ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve the release of hostages held for over 15 months.
Officials from Israel, Palestine, and the United States voiced cautious hope for a breakthrough in the coming days. An Israeli official, speaking to Xinhua, confirmed that mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and the United States had presented a draft proposal to both sides, with Israeli leaders briefed on its details. The number and identities of hostages and Palestinian prisoners slated for release, however, remain unresolved.
Negotiations are "in advanced stages," according to another Israeli government source, who estimated a deal could be finalized "within a day." Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official based in Doha said the group had delivered a "positive" response to the draft agreement mediated in Qatar.
"Hamas has raised no objections to the proposal, hoping a ceasefire can soon alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza," the official said.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV reported that the draft agreement outlines a three-stage plan. The first stage includes a 42-day ceasefire during which 33 hostages -- women, children, elderly individuals, and those with health conditions -- would be released. The Israeli military would withdraw from densely populated areas, allowing displaced Gazans to return to their homes in northern Gaza. Additionally, Israeli forces would vacate the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border and the Netzarim Corridor, separating Gaza's north and south.
By the 16th day of the ceasefire, talks would commence on subsequent phases, which include the delivery of urgently needed aid to Gaza and the release of a significant number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, the report said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar acknowledged "progress" in the negotiations, adding that teams were "working hard" to finalize the deal.
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan offered cautious optimism: "We've been close before and failed to cross the finish line. But the opportunity for a final agreement is within reach, and the steps to implement it could begin in the coming days."
By Monday evening, Israel's Hostages, Missing Persons, and Returnees Directorate declared its readiness for a potential agreement, citing weeks of preparation alongside government agencies to facilitate the return of hostages and their reintegration with their families.
Efforts to reach a deal have repeatedly faltered over key issues, including the permanence of a ceasefire, the scope of Israel's military withdrawal, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israel remains hesitant to release prisoners convicted of attacks on Israelis.
Internal political opposition also poses a significant challenge to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ultra-nationalist coalition partners Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have publicly condemned the deal. Smotrich described it as a "catastrophe" for national security and called for the total military occupation of Gaza. "This is the time to strike with full force, retake Gaza, and dismantle Hamas until it surrenders completely," he said.
Despite his objections, Smotrich has not threatened to withdraw his party from Netanyahu's coalition, which relies heavily on support from pro-settler factions.
The conflict escalated dramatically on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. To date, 98 hostages remain in captivity, with at least a third believed to have died.
Israel's military response has inflicted widespread destruction across Gaza. On Monday, health authorities in the Hamas-run territory reported that Israeli strikes had killed at least 46,584 people. â–

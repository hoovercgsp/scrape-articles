JERUSALEM, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel launched its annual Cybersecurity Week on Sunday, aiming to enhance public awareness of cyber threats through a series of nationwide activities organized by the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD).
The event involves the army, government branches, and other organizations. The INCD will also launch an extensive social media campaign to further enhance cybersecurity awareness.
Coinciding with the country's National Child Online Protection Month, this year's Cybersecurity Week will place an emphasis on the younger generation, featuring lectures on online safety at schools.
The event also introduces a "Cyber Ambassadors" initiative, under which 40 eighth-grade students would receive training from Microsoft and the INCD to serve as "information agents."
These students will educate their peers about the risks of cyber threats on social media and harmful content online, as well as ways to protect themselves in the cyber world. â–

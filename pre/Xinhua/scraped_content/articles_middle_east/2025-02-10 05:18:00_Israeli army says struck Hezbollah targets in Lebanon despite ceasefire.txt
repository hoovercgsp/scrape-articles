JERUSALEM/BEIRUT, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military said Sunday that it has launched airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in eastern and southern Lebanon.
An Israeli aircraft struck an underground tunnel used by Hezbollah for arms transfers in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa region, which extended from Syria into Lebanese territory and had previously been targeted by Israeli forces, an Israeli military spokesperson said.
The Israeli Air Force also struck sites in southern Lebanon that contained "munitions and rocket launchers that posed an imminent threat," the spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli fighter jets carried out multiple airstrikes on Sunday evening targeting areas in the Nabatieh region of southern Lebanon, the rugged outskirts of Hermel near the Lebanese-Syrian border, and areas in the eastern Bekaa region.
A ceasefire that took effect in November 2024 halted nearly 14 months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. Despite the truce, Israeli forces launched sporadic attacks in Lebanon, saying they were targeting Hezbollah positions that violated the ceasefire agreement.
The Lebanese government has repeatedly condemned the Israeli attacks. After Israel failed to meet the initial deadline to withdraw from southern Lebanon, the Lebanese authorities extended the deadline to Feb. 18. â–

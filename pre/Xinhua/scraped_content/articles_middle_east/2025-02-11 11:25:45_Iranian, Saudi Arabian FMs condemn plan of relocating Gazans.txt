TEHRAN, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi and his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, on Monday night condemned the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate Palestinians from Gaza.
In a phone call, the two foreign ministers discussed the developments in the West Asia region, including Gaza, and bilateral ties, according to a statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
The U.S.-Israeli plan to forcefully relocate Gazans to other countries was in line with the "completion of the colonialist plot to eliminate Palestine," Araghchi said, calling for the international community's "decisive action to oppose and counter the conspiracy."
He condemned the "impudent" remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had suggested establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia, describing the remarks as an indication of Israel's "unprecedented insolence and a threat against peace and security in the region."
Araghchi highlighted the necessity to convene an extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to deal with the issue.
He also stressed the importance of expanding relations between Tehran and Riyadh and continuing bilateral consultations on regional issues, which was welcomed by his Saudi Arabian counterpart.
The Saudi Arabian foreign minister, for his part, underscored his country's "fixed" position on decisively opposing any plan to forcefully relocate Palestinians from Gaza to other countries.
He welcomed Iran's proposal for holding an OIC meeting to adopt and declare a "united position against the conspiracy." â–

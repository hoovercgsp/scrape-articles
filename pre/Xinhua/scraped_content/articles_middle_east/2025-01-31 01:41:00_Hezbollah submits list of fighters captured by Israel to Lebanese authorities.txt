BEIRUT, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah has submitted a list of seven members currently detained by the Israeli army to Lebanese authorities, a Lebanese security source said Thursday.
The anonymous source added that it comes as part of U.S.-mediated negotiations to secure the release of Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli prisons since Oct. 7, 2023.
According to the source, the detainees include Kamel Younes, captured in the southern Lebanese village of Blida, as well as Hassan Jawad, Youssef Abdallah, Ibrahim Al-Khalil, Mohammed Jawad, and Hussein Sharif, who were taken in the Lebanese village of Alma al-Shaab. The seventh detainee, Imad Amhaz, was reportedly seized in an Israeli raid in Batroun, a coastal city in northern Lebanon, in early November of last year.
Lebanon's caretaker government said Monday that it has agreed to extend the ceasefire deal with Israel until Feb. 18 as the initial 60-day truce expired on Sunday. The decision came after the United States, which brokered the initial agreement, announced the extension of the truce deal, citing Israel's failure to withdraw from southern Lebanon before the deadline under the agreement.
The United States added it would soon begin negotiations with Israel and Lebanon on the return of Lebanese detainees captured by Israel after Oct. 7, 2023. â–

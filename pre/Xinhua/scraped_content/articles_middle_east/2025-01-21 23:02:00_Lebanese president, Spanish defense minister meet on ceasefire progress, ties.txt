BEIRUT, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Joseph Aoun called for Israel's immediate withdrawal from disputed territories during a meeting on Tuesday with Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles.
The talks come amid rising tensions along the border, exacerbated by violations of a recent ceasefire agreement.
Aoun warned that Israel's potential failure to meet the deadlines set in the Nov. 27 ceasefire accord would destabilize the region further and hinder reconstruction efforts in the border areas. Under the agreement, Israeli forces are required to withdraw by January 26.
The meeting, held at Baabda Palace, coincided with reports of Israeli military activity near the southern town of Bint Jbeil. According to Lebanon's National News Agency, Israeli forces were demolishing property gates and firing in the area. Artillery fire also targeted the Sedana Heights near Shebaa earlier on Tuesday.
Robles reiterated Spain's support for Lebanon and stressed the importance of Israel adhering to the agreed withdrawal timeline. She also reaffirmed Spain's commitment to the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), where Spanish troops serve under UNIFIL Commander Aroldo Lazaro Saenz.
In a separate discussion, Lebanese Defense Minister Maurice Slim expressed gratitude for Spain's military support, while condemning what he described as Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty and UN Resolution 1701. â–

GAZA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, released three Israeli hostages on Saturday as part of the fourth batch of an ongoing prisoner exchange and ceasefire deal.
The release took place in two separate locations in the war-torn Gaza Strip and was coordinated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
In Gaza City, Hamas militants handed over a 65-year-old Israeli-U.S. dual national, Keith Siegel, to the ICRC representatives. The hostage was among the dozens of civilians captured during the conflict on Oct. 7, 2023.
Meanwhile, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Hamas transferred to the ICRC another two Israeli hostages, Israeli-French citizen Ofer Calderon, 54, and Israeli civilian Yarden Bibas, 35.
The ongoing exchange is part of a negotiated agreement between Hamas and Israel, brokered by international mediators, including Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.
According to the Palestinian Prisoner's Society, Israel is expected to release 183 Palestinian prisoners later Saturday, including women, minors, and political detainees who were held under various security-related charges.
Taking effect on Jan. 19, the ceasefire agreement so far has facilitated the release of 13 Israeli hostages, five Thai workers and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The prisoner exchange process has been closely monitored by international organizations, with the ICRC playing a crucial role in ensuring the safe handover of hostages and prisoners.
Meanwhile, mediators continue negotiations to extend the ceasefire and potentially expand the terms of the prisoner swap to include more detainees on both sides.
Despite the temporary truce, tensions remain high in the region. Israeli officials have indicated that the current ceasefire is conditional and could be extended if further hostages are released.
Hamas, on the other hand, has signaled its willingness to negotiate broader terms but insists on securing the freedom of a more significant number of Palestinian prisoners and providing more ease for the Palestinian people in the coastal enclave, including the rebuilding of the territory.
As diplomatic efforts continue, humanitarian organizations have urged both parties to prioritize the protection of civilians, facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza, and work toward a lasting resolution to the conflict. â–

TEHRAN, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A top Iranian military commander said on Sunday the country is militarily capable of closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz, but will not resort to that option for now, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.
Commander of the Navy of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Alireza Tangsiri made the remarks in an address to reporters in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas, while answering a question about Iran's countermeasures in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats, as well as sanctions against the country's oil sector.
"Militarily, we are capable of closing the Strait of Hormuz, but we will not take such an action for now and by the time we, ourselves, are using the strait. The capabilities of our missiles, vessels, drones, and other equipment are beyond such issues," he said.
Tangsiri stressed that in recent years, Iran had always responded to hostile actions against the country, stressing that the country does not yield to coercion and remains committed to defending its national rights.
He dismissed U.S. efforts to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, asserting that Western sanctions have instead driven Iran to achieve significant advancements.
Trump said on Tuesday he would not let Iran "have a nuclear weapon" and issued an executive order reinstating a "maximum pressure" campaign against the country.
Located between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important oil chokepoints. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has postponed a planned visit to Washington indefinitely, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news website has reported, citing anonymous sources.
According to the report published Tuesday, Sisi's decision came after Jordanian King Abdullah II met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.
During a phone conversation earlier this month, Sisi and Trump exchanged invitations for official visits soon.
Egypt has made multiple responses recently to Trump's proposed plan on Gaza, firmly rejecting any proposal to allocate land for the relocation of Gaza residents, and closing the door on discussions about resettling Palestinians outside their territory, said the report.
The report added that Egypt has also formally requested clarifications from the U.S. regarding Trump's recent comments about potential sanctions.
In a statement released Tuesday night, the Egyptian foreign ministry announced the country's intention to put forward a comprehensive plan for the reconstruction of Gaza that will be designed to ensure the continued presence of the Palestinians on their land.
Earlier, Trump had proposed that the United States should take control of Gaza and that the Palestinians be relocated to neighboring Jordan and Egypt, which has been widely condemned.
Trump later threatened that the United States "could conceivably withhold aid" from Jordan and Egypt if the two countries did not agree to receive Palestinians. â–

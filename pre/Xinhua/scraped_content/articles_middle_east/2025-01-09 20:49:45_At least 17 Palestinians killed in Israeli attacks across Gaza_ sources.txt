GAZA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip on Thursday, Palestinian medical sources said.
Eight people were killed and dozens of others wounded in Israeli airstrikes on a house in Jabalia area in northern Gaza, said Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Civil Defense Authority in the enclave.
Five people were killed in an Israeli air raid on a house west of Deir al-Balah city in central Gaza, spokesperson for al-Aqsa Hospital Hussam al-Daqran said in a press statement.
In a separate attack, Awda Hospital in central Gaza reported in a press statement that the bodies of a father and his three children were brought to the hospital, following an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Local sources and eyewitnesses reported that Israeli vehicles opened fire northwest of Nuseirat camp, while the northern areas of the camp were hit by artillery shelling.
In the southern Gaza Strip, Israeli artillery shelled areas east of Khan Younis amid gunfire, and Israeli military vehicles shelled the Mawasi area in Rafah city and opened heavy fire there, according to Palestinian witnesses.
Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostages.
The Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, has surpassed 46,000, the Gaza-based health authorities said Thursday. â–

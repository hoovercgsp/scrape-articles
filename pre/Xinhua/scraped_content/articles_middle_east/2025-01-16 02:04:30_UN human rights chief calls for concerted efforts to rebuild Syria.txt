DAMASCUS, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk on Wednesday urged the international community to reconsider sanctions on Syria and focus on efforts to rebuild the war-torn nation.
He made the remarks during his visit to Syria to reinforce the UN's commitment to human rights in the region.
"The people of Syria need every ounce of help they can get to rebuild a country that works for all Syrians," Turk said during a press conference in Damascus on Wednesday, emphasizing the need for concerted national efforts to restore stability.
Turk highlighted the continued challenges to Syria's territorial integrity and sovereignty, calling for an end to the ongoing hostilities.
"There are still very real threats to Syria's territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty, which must be fully respected and rigorously upheld. The ongoing conflict and hostilities must end," he said.
Addressing the impact of international sanctions on the Syrian people, Turk called for "urgent reconsideration of sectoral sanctions with a view to lifting them."
Turk also underscored the importance of equality and inclusivity in Syria's rebuilding efforts. "Rebuilding a Syria that works for all its people, equal in dignity and without discrimination, will be key to its success and stability," he said.
Turk's visit comes as Syria is navigating a key transitional phase after the overthrow of the previous government and faces mounting challenges, including a protracted humanitarian crisis, economic difficulties, and ongoing security concerns. â–

ISTANBUL, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Airlines, Türkiye's flag carrier, resumed direct flights to Damascus on Thursday, ending a nearly 13-year hiatus, the airline said.
The carrier will operate three weekly flights from Istanbul to Damascus, according to a post on social media platform X. "Passengers can now book their seats," the post added.
The resumption comes amid a broader regional push to normalize ties with the Syrian government, which has faced international isolation since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.
Turkish Airlines last flew to Syria on March 31, 2012, shortly before the conflict escalated.
Türkiye reopened its embassy in Damascus on Dec. 14, 2024 shortly after the ouster of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ■

DAMASCUS, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) delegation, led by Commissioner for Equality and Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib, met on Friday with Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria's interim leader, vowing to provide an aid package worth 235 million euros (241 million U.S. dollars) to assist Syrians.
During a press conference, Lahbib hailed Syria's "historic transition" as an opportunity for citizens to overcome decades of conflict and despair, urging an inclusive vision for the nation's future.
"The Syrian people are rewriting history, and we encourage them to build a society that represents everyone," Lahbib said. She added that peace, stability, and justice "are what Syrians deserve."
"We will continue to reduce suffering and address people's most urgent needs," she said, emphasizing the EU's commitment to supporting a post-war recovery process. â–

BEIRUT, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun hosted Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides here on Friday, discussing bilateral relations and Lebanon's pressing needs.
During their talks at the presidential palace, Aoun said Lebanon insisted on the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territories and the deployment of the Lebanese army along the southern border, according to a statement released by Lebanon's Presidency.
Aoun expressed his gratitude for the Cypriot president's visit on the second day of his presidency, considering the visit a message of hope for all Lebanese.

BAGHDAD, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Wednesday that Iraq rejects any attempts that aim to displace the Palestinian people.
Hussien's remarks came during a phone call with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, during which they discussed developments in Palestine after the ceasefire and ways to enhance joint coordination to support the Palestinian people, according to a statement issued by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
Hussein reaffirmed Iraq's stance in supporting the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the importance of unifying efforts to enhance their resilience on their land, the statement said.
Iraq will continue to exert maximum efforts to ensure that the Palestinian cause and the support for the rights of the Palestinian people are at the forefront of the priorities of the Arab Summit, which will be hosted in Baghdad this year, the statement added.
For his part, Mustafa expressed his appreciation for Iraq's positions in support of Palestine, stressing the importance of continuing cooperation and coordination across various areas.
U.S. President Donald Trump proposed last week to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan. â–

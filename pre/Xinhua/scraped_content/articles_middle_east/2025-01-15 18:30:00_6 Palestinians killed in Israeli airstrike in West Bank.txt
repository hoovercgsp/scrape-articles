RAMALLAH, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- At least six Palestinians were killed and several others injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said on Tuesday.
In a press statement, the ministry said that six bodies were brought to Jenin Governmental Hospital following the Israeli strike on the camp. The identities of the deceased have not yet been determined.
Meanwhile, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement, "In a joint operation by the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet, an Air Force drone recently targeted a site in the Jenin area," without providing further details.
Local Palestinian sources reported that an Israeli drone struck one of the neighborhoods in the camp with three missiles.
In an official statement, Palestinian security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab condemned the Israeli airstrike, calling it a "crime."
The occupation army launched a premeditated airstrike on the Jenin refugee camp, deliberately attempting to disrupt national efforts aimed at protecting the Palestinian people, he said, adding that the security forces have been actively engaged in local efforts to restore security and stability in Jenin.
The West Bank has been witnessing a continuous escalation since October 2023, with more than 800 Palestinians killed, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. â–

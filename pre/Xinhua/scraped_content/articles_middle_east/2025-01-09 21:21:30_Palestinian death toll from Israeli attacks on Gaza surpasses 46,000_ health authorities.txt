GAZA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, 2023, has reached 46,006, with injuries up to 109,378, health authorities in Gaza announced Thursday.
"During the past 24 hours, the Israeli army killed about 70 Palestinians and wounded around 104 others. The victims included women and children," the ministry said in a press statement sent to Xinhua.
There are still victims stuck under the rubble and on the streets as the Israeli army has prevented Civil Defense teams from reaching them, it said.
Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostages. â–

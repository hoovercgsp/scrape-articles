JERUSALEM, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- An army crane collapsed in the northern Gaza Strip Wednesday night, killing two Israeli soldiers and injuring eight others, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and media reports.
Israel's state-owned Kan TV News reported that due to stormy weather, the crane collapsed onto a tent housing IDF's Golani Brigade troops. One of the injured was listed in serious condition.
It added that the incident occurred inside an IDF compound near the Gaza border, where IDF forces are conducting ongoing missions despite the current ceasefire.
The IDF has launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, particularly regarding the forces' conduct.
According to Kan TV, the forces were expected to prepare for stormy weather and strong winds by securing the crane or lowering it until the weather conditions improved.
Cranes like the one involved in the incident are used by the IDF to deploy observation devices and communication antennas, using a hydraulic arm capable of rising to heights of tens of meters. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has postponed an emergency Arab summit on the Palestinian issue in Cairo to March 4, rescheduling it from the previous date of Feb. 27, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.
The decision was made in coordination with Bahrain, the current chair of the Arab League (AL) summit and the AL secretariat, and followed consultations with Arab states, to ensure "substantive and logistical preparations" for the summit, the ministry said in a statement.
The summit in Cairo is planned to address the latest developments concerning the Palestinian cause and the Gaza Strip.
The announcement comes amid the ongoing diplomatic efforts to sustain the Gaza ceasefire that began on Jan. 19, while countering controversial proposals by the United States regarding the future of Gaza. â–

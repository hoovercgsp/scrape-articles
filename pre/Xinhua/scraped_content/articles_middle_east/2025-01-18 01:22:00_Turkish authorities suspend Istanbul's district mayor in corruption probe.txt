ISTANBUL, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities on Friday suspended and formally arrested Riza Akpolat, the mayor of Istanbul's central Besiktas district, as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged corruption in municipal tender processes.
The Istanbul Governor's Office confirmed that the suspension was approved by the Interior Ministry. The Besiktas Municipal Council is scheduled to convene on Jan. 23 to elect a new deputy major, according to a statement released by the office.
Akpolat, a member of the main opposition Republican People's Party, has been in detention since Monday alongside 46 others. The suspects are accused of "membership in a criminal organization," "manipulating tenders," and "unlawful acquisition of assets."
Akpolat, who was elected mayor of Besiktas in 2019, has denied the accusations. â–

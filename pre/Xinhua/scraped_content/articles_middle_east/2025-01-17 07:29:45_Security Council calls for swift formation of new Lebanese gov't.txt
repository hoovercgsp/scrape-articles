UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council on Thursday called for all parties in Lebanon to "demonstrate renewed unity," and urged the new authorities to swiftly form a government.
In a presidential statement adopted unanimously, the council welcomed the election of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and the designation of Nawaf Salam as prime minister, describing the recent developments as "a long-awaited and critical step" to overcome its political and institutional crisis.
Last week, Aoun was elected the new president of Lebanon, ending a two-year presidential vacuum that had paralyzed the country's political system. He then named Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as the new prime minister.
Meanwhile, the Security Council expressed concern about the reported violations of the cessation of hostilities arrangement between Israel and Lebanon reached in November 2024, and called for the full implementation of the deal.
The council reaffirmed its support for Lebanon's territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence in accordance with Council resolution 1701 (2006), the statement said.
It called on the international community to extend humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people, including through facilitating the safe return of displaced persons.
The 15-nation organ "also called for further international assistance to help facilitate the country's reconstruction and development; strengthen state institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces; and help secure a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution to the conflict," the statement said. â–

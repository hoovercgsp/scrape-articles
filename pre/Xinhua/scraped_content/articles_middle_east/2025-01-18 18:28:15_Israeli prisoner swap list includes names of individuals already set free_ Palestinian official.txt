RAMALLAH, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli list of Palestinian prisoners for release in a prisoner swap deal with Hamas includes names of individuals who had already been set free, a Palestinian official has said.
Thaer Shreiteh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority's Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, on Friday referred to the list published on the Israeli Justice Ministry's website.
"We do not trust the data published by the Israeli occupation authorities and their prison administration," he said, noting that the Israeli ministry also included birth dates for 10 Palestinian prisoners to be released without providing additional details about them.
He called on Egyptian and Qatari mediators to address these "violations and prevent the occupation authorities from exploiting any loopholes to create confusion among the Palestinian public and the families of the prisoners."
Israel's Justice Ministry announced on Friday that Israel would release 95 Palestinian detainees on Sunday in the first phase of the prisoner exchange in return for the release of three Israeli female hostages held in Gaza.
The ministry said the release of the Palestinian detainees would not take place until 4 p.m. Israeli time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
On Wednesday, Egypt, Qatar and the United States announced in a joint statement that a ceasefire deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas, halting more than 15 months of fighting between the two sides.
The agreement is made up of three phases, with the first phase lasting 42 days. During this phase, 33 Israeli hostages will be freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees.
Since Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas and Israel have been engaged in a fierce conflict that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza and caused unprecedented destruction. The conflict began after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing Israelis and taking hostages. â–

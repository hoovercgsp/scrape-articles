JERUSALEM, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian militants in Jenin, northern West Bank, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) said in a joint statement on Friday.
According to the statement, in a joint activity with ISA on Thursday, the IDF and additional forces encircled a structure and killed the two militants inside.
IDF soldiers had engaged in close-quarters combat with the two militants before killing them, during which an Israeli soldier was killed and five others injured.
Since January 21, the IDF, ISA, and Israel Border Police have been conducting a military campaign named "Iron Wall" in the West Bank's Jenin and Tulkarm to dismantle what they called "terrorist groups" and to maintain military control in the occupied territory.
Throughout the operation, dozens of Palestinian militants have been killed, wounded, or arrested, and numerous homes have been demolished. â–

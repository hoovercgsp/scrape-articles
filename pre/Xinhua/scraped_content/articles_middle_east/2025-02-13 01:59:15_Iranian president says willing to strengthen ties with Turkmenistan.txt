TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday affirmed Iran's commitment to strengthening ties with Turkmenistan during a meeting with Turkmen Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov in Tehran.
During the meeting, Pezeshkian emphasized Iran's policy of good neighborliness and highlighted "friendly and kinship" relations with Turkmenistan, according to a statement published on the website of his office.
Pezeshkian mentioned his recent call with Chairman of the People's Council of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, saying that he had instructed Iranian officials to explore further cooperation and remove obstacles to joint projects.
Meredov, for his part, pointed to the existing agreements and joint cooperation projects between the two countries in different areas, including transportation and energy, and called for the expansion of bilateral cooperation in all areas.
Iran and Turkmenistan, both rich in natural gas reserves, have maintained economic ties for decades. Iran and Turkmenistan have established significant natural gas swap agreements to enhance regional energy cooperation.
Earlier in the day, Meredov held a joint press conference with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, where both sides emphasized fostering collaboration in trade, energy, electricity, gas, transportation, and ecology, according to the official news agency IRNA. â–

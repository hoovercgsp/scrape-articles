BEIRUT, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a group of people near the Shebaa Farms in southern Lebanon, a Lebanese military source said on Sunday.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua that an Israeli drone fired an air-to-ground missile at the Bastra area south of the town of Shebaa, resulting in the fatalities.
The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on Saturday that its air force had identified and attacked three "suspects" near the Israeli-annexed Shebaa Farms area.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's General Directorate of Civil Defense announced on Sunday it had retrieved two bodies in the Lebanese town of Khiam, the bodies and remains of eight people in the town of Naqoura, two bodies in the village of Biyyadah, and one body in the village of Tayr Harfa.
A ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, aiming to halt nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.
However, despite the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli army still carries out strikes in Lebanon, some of which resulted in deaths and injuries. Israel also accuses Hezbollah of ceasefire violations. â–

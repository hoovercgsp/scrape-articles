GAZA, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), on Sunday, underscored the urgent need to support the agency in maintaining its role as a key player in implementing the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
"UNRWA must be supported to continue as a key implementer of the fragile ceasefire deal," Lazzarini said in a statement.
He highlighted UNRWA's broad mandate and strong trust within local communities in Gaza, describing the agency as a model for humanitarian work in a region where people have endured 15 months of continuous bombardment and displacement.
Since the ceasefire took effect two weeks ago, UNRWA has delivered food aid to more than 1.2 million people, Lazzarini said. He added that the agency would continue working with the World Food Programme to ensure aid reaches all those in need across the enclave.
UNRWA has also opened 10 new shelters to accommodate returnees to northern Gaza, distributing tents, blankets, plastic covers, and warm clothing as storms and heavy rains persist.
The agency has repaired water wells, provided water services, and managed waste disposal for around 500,000 people in and around its shelters. It has also supplied its primary healthcare teams with medical supplies, enabling them to offer up to 17,000 medical consultations daily through clinics and mobile units, Lazzarini said.
Israel formally prohibited UNRWA from operating within its territory in January. Consequently, Lazzarini stated that international staff were forced to leave East Jerusalem due to expired visas. However, he noted that operations in Gaza and the West Bank remain unaffected. â–

BEIRUT, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on Wednesday called on European nations to support Lebanon in demanding Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territories it occupied during the recent war, according to a statement by the Lebanese presidency.
The president made the remarks during his meeting in Beirut with Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon, during which he emphasized the need for the European Union (EU) to push for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement reached on Nov. 27, 2024 between Israel and Lebanon.
He also highlighted that the agreement includes the release of Lebanese prisoners held in Israel, with a deadline set for Feb. 18.
Aoun expressed gratitude to Fajon for Slovenia's support of Lebanon at the UN Security Council, where it holds a non-permanent seat until the end of the year. He also reaffirmed Lebanon's commitment to UN Security Council resolution 1701, and insisted that Israel must also adhere to it.
He noted that Lebanon's priority, following the formation of a new government, would be rebuilding areas destroyed by Israeli aggression, particularly in the south, and welcomed EU's support in these efforts.
For her part, Fajon reaffirmed Slovenia's solidarity with Lebanon and pledged to coordinate with EU nations to assist in its recovery. She also confirmed that Slovenia would continue advocating for Lebanon at the UN Security Council.
The meeting also addressed bilateral relations, regional developments, and challenges facing both the Middle East and Europe, including the recent developments in Syria, the statement said.
The Lebanese caretaker government had previously announced its approval of an extension to the ceasefire agreement with Israel until Feb. 18, after the initial 60-day period expired on Jan. 26 without a complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli army has continued to carry out strikes in Lebanon, resulting in casualties, claiming they are aimed at eliminating threats posed by Hezbollah. â–

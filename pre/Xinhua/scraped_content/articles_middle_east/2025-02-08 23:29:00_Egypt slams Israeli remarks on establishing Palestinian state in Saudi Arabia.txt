CAIRO, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt strongly condemned on Saturday the "irresponsible and utterly unacceptable" statements by Israeli officials suggesting establishing a Palestinian state on Saudi territory.
Such "unbridled" remarks are a direct violation of Saudi sovereignty and a blatant breach of the international law and the UN Charter, and constitute a reprehensible transgression and infringement on all established diplomatic norms, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
They also threaten the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state on all their national territory in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem based on the 1967 borders, it said.
Egypt categorically rejects these reckless statements that affect the security and sovereignty of Saudi Arabia, which are "a red line" for Egypt, it said.
Egypt also calls on the international community to condemn and denounce such remarks, it added. â–

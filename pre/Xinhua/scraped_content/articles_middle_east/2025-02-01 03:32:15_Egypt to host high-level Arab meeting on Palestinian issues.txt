CAIRO, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced on Friday that foreign ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Palestine are set to convene in Cairo on Saturday.
The meeting will also be attended by the secretary-general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the secretary-general of the Arab League, according to the ministry's statement.
The meeting will focus on several critical issues, including U.S. President Donald Trump's proposals concerning the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan. Both nations have previously voiced strong opposition to such a move.
The ministers are also expected to address the ongoing situation in the Gaza Strip, particularly the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, and explore methods to assist Palestinians in Gaza in rebuilding their livelihoods.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan and the PLO secretary-general are scheduled to hold a separate meeting on Saturday.
On Jan. 15, Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, acting as mediators, released a joint statement announcing that Hamas and Israel had reached an agreement encompassing a prisoner and detainee exchange and a return to sustainable calm, thus establishing a lasting ceasefire.
Under the ongoing ceasefire, 33 hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza are to be freed in the first six weeks of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. â–

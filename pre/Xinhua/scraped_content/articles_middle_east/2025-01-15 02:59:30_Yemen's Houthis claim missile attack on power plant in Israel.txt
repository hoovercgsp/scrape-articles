SANAA, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group said in a statement on Tuesday that it targeted a power plant in the southern Israeli port city of Eilat, using a "winged missile."
"The attack achieved its goal successfully," Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in the statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.
Also, Sarea said his group carried out another attack against Israel, targeting vital targets in Tel Aviv city with several bomb-laden drones.
He vowed that his group's attacks against Israel "will not stop until Israel stops war in Gaza and lifts its siege."
The attacks against the power station in Eilat and targets in Tel Aviv came a few hours after the Houthi group took responsibility for launching a ballistic rocket attack against the Israeli Defense Ministry.
Earlier in the day, Israeli media said the Houthi rocket attack was intercepted by the Israeli air defense system.
Since November 2023, the Houthis group has been carrying out rocket and drone attacks on Israel and disrupting "Israeli-linked" shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians amid their ongoing conflict with Israelis. â–

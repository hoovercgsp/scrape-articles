BEIRUT, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on Sunday night, targeting areas surrounding Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon for the first time since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024.
Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) reported that the raids hit the town of Jenta in the Baalbek-Hermel district, but did not provide information on whether there were any casualties.
Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon, Israeli warplanes conducted six intense airstrikes targeting several areas, according to NNA.
The ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, was meant to end nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The terms of the agreement include Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territory within 60 days, with the Lebanese army taking over security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. The agreement also bans any presence of weapons or militants in the region.
Despite the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli army has continued to carry out strikes in Lebanon, though at a reduced intensity, with some of them resulting in deaths and injuries. â–

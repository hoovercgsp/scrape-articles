TEHRAN, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday launched a military drill involving border guards from three northwestern provinces of Ardabil, East Azarbaijan, and West Azarbaijan, the official news agency IRNA reported.
The exercise is being held at the Jolfa border area, which lies along the borders with Armenia and Azerbaijan, in Iran's East Azarbaijan Province.
The drill aims to enhance coordination among the border units of the three provinces and strengthen their military capabilities, said the IRNA. Speaking at the event, Iran's Police Chief Ahmad-Reza Radan emphasized that the exercise was designed to improve operational preparedness at Jolfa's tactical firing range.
He further noted that Iranian forces continuously monitored movements near the country's borders using electronic and optical systems and were in full control of the boundaries.
The Iranian armed forces have conducted several drills over the past few days and military officials have said that additional exercises will take place in the coming weeks to strengthen their military preparedness against potential threats. â–

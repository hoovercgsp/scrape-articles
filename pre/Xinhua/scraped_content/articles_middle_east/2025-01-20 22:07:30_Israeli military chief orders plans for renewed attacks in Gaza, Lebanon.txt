JERUSALEM, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi on Monday instructed the army to prepare plans for renewed attacks in Gaza and Lebanon, a day after the fragile Gaza ceasefire came into effect.
In a situational assessment meeting, Halevi "instructed the preparation of plans for continued combat operations -- both in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon," according to a statement from the military.
While offensive operations have ceased, there were "intensified preparations for defense in the Gaza Strip," he said.
The military "must be prepared for significant operations in the West Bank in the coming days to preempt and apprehend terrorists before they reach our civilians," he added.
Halevi did not elaborate on the reasons for preparing the attack plans.
On Jan. 15, Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire-for-hostage release deal following intensive mediation efforts by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The agreement includes an initial 42-day phase, during which more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt, and 33 hostages held in Gaza will be released in exchange for the release of several hundred Palestinian prisoners.
Far-right Israeli ministers have opposed the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Sunday. Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has demanded "guarantees" that Israel would renew its assault on Gaza after the first phase of the deal is implemented.
Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his party have submitted their resignation to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government on Sunday, citing opposition to the Gaza ceasefire deal. This has put Netanyahu in the danger of losing his majority and potentially triggering new elections.
In Lebanon, a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, aiming to halt nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. â–

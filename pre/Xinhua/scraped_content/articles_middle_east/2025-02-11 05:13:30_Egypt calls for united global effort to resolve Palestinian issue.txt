CAIRO, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday urged the international community to support a political vision for resolving the Palestinian issue, emphasizing the need to end historical injustices and restore Palestinian rights.
In a statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said the only way to ensure regional stability is by recognizing the rights of all people, including Palestinians, who continue to face unprecedented injustice. It rejected any infringement on their rights, including self-determination, land sovereignty, and independence.
Egypt reaffirmed its commitment to the right of return for Palestinian refugees, in line with international law and humanitarian principles. It warned that ignoring international legitimacy risks undermining decades of peace efforts.
Egypt pledged to work with regional and global partners toward a comprehensive peace, calling for an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
The statement followed remarks by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who said Gaza residents relocated to neighboring countries under his plan would have no right of return. â–

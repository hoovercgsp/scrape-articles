CAIRO, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 94 Palestinian patients and 125 accompanying individuals from the Gaza Strip have entered Egypt through the Rafah crossing since Saturday, Egypt's press center said in a statement on Monday.
On Monday alone, 23 patients and 24 companions arrived in Egypt, according to the statement.
The first group of 37 Gazan patients and 38 accompanying individuals entered Egypt on Saturday, following the reopening of the Rafah crossing, which had been closed since May 2024.
Palestinian media said most of the patients were children suffering from cancer and heart disease, as well as individuals injured in the ongoing conflict.
On Jan. 19, the Rafah crossing was reopened from the Egyptian side as part of a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. Since May 2024, the Palestinian side of the crossing has been controlled by Israel, which had blocked its operation until the recent ceasefire agreement. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military has withdrawn from the Naqoura area in southwestern Lebanon, transferring control of the region to the Lebanese army, Israel's state-owned Kan TV reported on Monday.
Israeli military spokesperson is not immediately available to confirm the move to Xinhua.
Under the terms of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah must relocate its fighters and weapons north of the Litani River by Jan. 26.
By the same deadline, Israel is required to fully withdraw its forces south of the Blue Line, the United Nations-demarcated border between Lebanon and Israel, while the Lebanese army is to take control of the area.
The ceasefire agreement ended months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that began in October 2023. However, both sides have traded accusations of ceasefire violations, underscoring the fragility of the truce. â–

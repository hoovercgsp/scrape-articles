TEHRAN, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has expressed its readiness to cooperate with Saudi Arabia in the area of information and communications technology (ICT), the official news agency IRNA reported on Sunday.
In a meeting in Tehran, Iranian ICT Minister Seyed Sattar Hashemi and Saudi Ambassador to Iran Abdullah bin Saud al-Anzi stressed the need to promote bilateral relations and cooperation across various sectors and at different levels, the report said.
The Iranian minister outlined different areas for cooperation between the two countries, especially in ICT, adding the two countries could prioritize cooperation in data transit. He also stressed other potential areas for bilateral cooperation, including developing communication infrastructure, advancing e-government initiatives, and ensuring cybersecurity.
Hashemi expressed Iran's readiness to share scientific and technical expertise with Saudi Arabia, adding that the two countries could exchange ICT delegations and experts.
The Saudi ambassador, for his part, emphasized the importance of expanding bilateral relations and cooperation in different fields, affirming his country's readiness to support these efforts.
Iran and Saudi Arabia formally declared in April 2023 the resumption of diplomatic relations with immediate effect.
Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in early 2016 in response to attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. The attacks followed Saudi Arabia's execution of a Shiite cleric. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- The sixth edition of Art Cairo, currently underway at the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), is captivating art lovers with a stunning array of contemporary Arab art.
Running from Feb. 7 to 11 under the theme "Peace to All Nations," the event brings together over 300 artists and 35 galleries from across the Arab world and Europe, showcasing more than 3,500 works of art.
The exhibition features a diverse range of artistic expressions, including paintings, sculptures, installations, and mixed-media pieces such as intricate embroidery on canvas. The event also showcases a mix of artistic styles, from abstract paintings and realistic portraits to conceptual pieces that challenge ideas and spark discussion.
A major highlight of Art Cairo is the "Egyptian Sarcophagi" series by Syrian contemporary artist Nizar Sabour, featuring paintings of iconic Egyptian figures such as singer Umm Kulthum, Nobel laureate novelist Naguib Mahfouz, and composer Mohamed Abdel Wahab.
These elongated vertical portraits are inspired by Phoenician anthropoid sarcophagi and ancient Egyptian funerary traditions, with a halo of light circling each honored figure, reminiscent of sacred iconography.
His "Egyptian Sarcophagi" is part of a larger artistic exploration project following his previous "Syrian Sarcophagi" and "Lebanese Sarcophagi."
Sabour stressed the importance of artistic gatherings like Art Cairo in the Arab world, calling them a vital platform for exchanging expertise.
"We need such spaces for artistic communication, where artists can meet, interact, and assess their artworks. These gatherings not only enrich Arab art but also foster direct engagement between Arab artists," he said.
Among the Egyptian artists participating in Art Cairo is Mohamed Abla, a renowned visual artist known for his contributions to contemporary Egyptian art.
"This event is important, and we fully support it. It's great to see strong participation from Arab countries this year, and I hope this diversity continues to grow in the future," Abla said.
Abla underscored the connection between ancient and contemporary art through holding the fair at the GEM, whose official opening is approaching, noting that attendance has been strong, with a noticeable presence of young people.
Jon Kapp, an American visitor from New York who lives and works in Egypt, expressed his excitement to explore the art in the Arab world.
"I am excited to discover the different stories being told through the artworks," Kapp said. â–

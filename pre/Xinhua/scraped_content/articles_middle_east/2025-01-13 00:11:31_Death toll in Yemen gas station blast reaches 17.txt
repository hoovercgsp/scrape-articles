ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were killed and 74 injured, including 50 critically, in a gas station explosion in Yemen's central province of Al-Bayda, health authorities under Houthi control said on Sunday.
The explosion occurred on Saturday in the Zaher district, where medical and emergency response teams are continuing search operations for potential missing persons, the health authorities said in a brief statement. Civil defense units are working to secure the area.
Meanwhile, the Houthi-controlled interior ministry said the blast impacted four gas stations and nearby commercial facilities, causing significant material damage. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the incident.
A local government official had earlier reported that the explosion killed at least 10 people and injured more than 65.
Al-Bayda province has been under Houthi control for several years. Yemen, ravaged by nearly a decade of conflict, has seen several similar accidents at gas and fuel stations in recent years, often attributed to inadequate safety measures and poor regulatory oversight. â–

TEHRAN, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Two senior judges were killed on Saturday morning in a shooting attack at the Supreme Court of Iran in central Tehran, the Mizan news agency of the Iranian judiciary reported.
Mizan said that the two judges were Ali Razini, head of Branch 39, and Mohammad Moghiseh, head of Branch 53, of the Supreme Court, and that the assailant committed suicide soon after the attack.
Calling the attack a "premeditated act of terror" carried out by an "armed infiltrator," Mizan said investigations were underway to identify and arrest those behind the "terrorist" action.
Meanwhile, the semi-official Fars news agency, citing an informed source at Tehran's police, reported that the attacker was among the service personnel of the Supreme Court.
It said a bodyguard was also injured in the incident.
So far no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. â–

ISTANBUL, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Sunday that Türkiye has been "actively" urging the international community to support Syria's reconstruction efforts.
Speaking at a meeting in Nigde province located in the Anatolian region, Fidan highlighted Türkiye's ongoing efforts to lift sanctions on Syria and assist the country in rebuilding infrastructure.
"When Syria becomes wealthier, safer, and more stable, Türkiye and the entire region will benefit as well," he said.
The minister stressed that Türkiye seeks peace and stability in the region and neighboring countries, with its foreign policies and efforts centering on this goal.
Fidan also called for the removal of sanctions on Syria, including trade restrictions and asset freezes, to boost the war-torn country's economic recovery, which he said will inspire millions of Syrian refugees to return home.
Sharing a 900-km borderline with Syria, Türkiye is currently home to almost 3 million Syrian refugees. Since the collapse of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government on Dec. 8, 2024, nearly 40,000 Syrians have returned to their homeland from Türkiye, according to the latest Turkish data. ■

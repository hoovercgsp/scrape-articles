BEIRUT, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and 44 others injured on Sunday after the Israeli army opened fire on crowds of Lebanese trying to return to their homes in southern Lebanon, according to an updated toll by the Lebanese Health Ministry.
In a statement, the ministry identified the victims as residents of the villages of Aita al-Shaab, Deir Siriane, and Bint Jbeil, while the injured were from the villages of Aadchit Al Qusayr, al-Taybeh, Qantara, and other areas in southeastern Lebanon. They were killed or injured while attempting to enter their still-occupied hometowns.
A Lebanese security source, who requires anonymity, said Lebanese army units escorting citizens back to the al-Mufayleha area were met with Israeli machine-gun fire, resulting in the injury of two citizens and a Lebanese soldier.
Sunday marks the end of a 60-day deadline for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territories. Under a ceasefire agreement reached in late November after months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, the Lebanese army would take control of the areas south of the Litani River, ensuring its security and preventing any presence of weapons and militants.
Despite the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli army has continued to carry out strikes in Lebanon, some of which have caused deaths and injuries in the border areas. â–

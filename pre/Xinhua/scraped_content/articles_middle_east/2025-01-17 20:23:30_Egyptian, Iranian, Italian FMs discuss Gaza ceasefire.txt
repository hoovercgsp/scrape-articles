CAIRO, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held separate phone talks with his Iranian and Italian counterparts to exchange views on a recently reached ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
In his talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, Abdelatty stressed, "Egypt attaches high importance to implementing the deal with no delay," reiterating the importance of urgent and sustainable access to relief and medical aid for the Gaza Strip.
Araghchi hailed the Egyptian efforts and pivotal role in helping achieve the deal.
The Egyptian foreign minister highlighted the role that the international community should play in reconstructing Gaza, rehabilitating its infrastructure, and restoring security and stability to its people.
The two ministers also discussed regional developments, especially the tensions in the Red Sea.
Abdelatty said he hopes that the ceasefire deal will restore stability and calm and reduce escalation in the Red Sea region in a way that maintains the freedom of international traffic.
In his discussions with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, the Egyptian foreign minister reviewed the Egyptian mediation efforts in coordination with Qatar and the United States to reach the deal.
Tajani welcomed the deal, praising the Egyptian efforts that contributed directly to concluding the truce agreement.

GAZA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, announced Thursday that its military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement, Abu Obeida, spokesperson for the brigades, also confirmed that Marwan Issa, Al-Qassam's deputy chief of staff, had been killed.
"The enemy has assassinated two of our great leaders, but their legacy and resistance will continue," Obeida said.
He added that the assassination of Hamas military leaders will not stop the Palestinian resistance against Israel.
No additional details were provided.
On Aug. 1, 2024, Israel's military claimed that it had killed Deif in an airstrike in southern Gaza's Khan Younis. Israel has accused Deif of being one of the masterminds of the Hamas attack on southern Israeli towns on Oct. 7, 2023. â–

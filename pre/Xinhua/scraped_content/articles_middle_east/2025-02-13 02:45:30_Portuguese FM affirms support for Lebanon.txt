BEIRUT, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel on Wednesday voiced support for Lebanon, and expressed confidence in the country's political path, according to a statement from Lebanon's presidency.
During a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in Beirut, Rangel underscored his country's commitment to supporting Lebanon in various areas, including strengthening institutions, particularly its military, as well as enhancing the role of the UN peacekeeping mission in ensuring security.
Highlighting Lebanon's historical role as a bridge between East and West, Rangel stressed that Lebanon can continue to serve as a model of peace in the region, provided there is balance and open dialogue among moderate communities.
On the Palestinian issue, Rangel reiterated Portugal's steadfast support for a two-state solution, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the empowerment of the Palestinian Authority to lead the process. He also stressed the need to maintain the ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon.
For his part, Aoun reaffirmed Lebanon's supporting stance on the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the Arab Peace Initiative adopted in 2002. He firmly rejected any proposals that could lead to the displacement of Palestinians or undermine their legitimate rights enshrined in UN resolutions. Aoun called on the European Union to exert pressure on Israel to complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by the Feb. 18 deadline and adhere to previously agreed terms.
Addressing the issue of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Aoun highlighted the economic and social burden they represent. He reiterated Lebanon's call for their return to Syria, arguing that the conditions that once justified their presence in Lebanon no longer exist. He urged EU nations to facilitate their repatriation rather than prolong their stay. â–

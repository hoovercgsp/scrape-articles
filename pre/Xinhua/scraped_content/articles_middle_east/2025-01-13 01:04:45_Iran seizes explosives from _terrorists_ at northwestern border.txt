TEHRAN, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian border guards have seized 10 rucksacks containing explosive materials from "terrorists" at the northwestern border, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Sunday.
Upon receiving reports of movements by "terrorist" groups near the border with Iraq's Kurdistan region, border forces from Sardasht County, West Azarbaijan province, were immediately sent to the area to take the necessary actions, Mehr quoted Iran's Border Guards Commander Ahmad Ali Goudarzi as saying.
The border guards opened heavy fire after spotting the "terrorists," who sought to enter the country, forcing them to abandon their belongings and flee the area, he added.
After carefully inspecting the area, the border guards discovered 10 rucksacks containing 15 packs of explosive materials weighing nearly 77 kg, as well as 5,000 electronic detonators and other items, Goudarzi said.
The report did not specify the date of the operation. â–

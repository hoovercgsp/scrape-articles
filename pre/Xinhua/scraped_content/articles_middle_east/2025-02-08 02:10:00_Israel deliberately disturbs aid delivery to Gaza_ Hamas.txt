GAZA, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Hamas on Friday accused Israel of deliberately delaying the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement by disturbing the delivery of humanitarian aid and relief to the enclave.
"Israel has failed to uphold its commitments under the agreement," Salama Marouf, head of the Gaza-based media office, said in a press conference.
"The scale of aid allowed into Gaza remains far below what is needed to meet the basic needs of the population," Marouf said, noting that only 8,500 aid trucks have entered Gaza so far, instead of the agreed 12,000.
Israel has also restricted the entry of fuel, allowing only 15 trucks per day instead of the agreed 50, Marouf said, adding that it has blocked critical medical supplies, delayed the evacuation of the injured and the sick, and prevented the entry of essential reconstruction materials.
He urged global pressure on Israel for fully implementing the agreement, lifting restrictions on aid, and facilitating reconstruction efforts.
He also called for an emergency international conference to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and support the rebuilding of its infrastructure.
Israel and Hamas reached a three-stage ceasefire deal in January, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, after more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza.
The initial stage effective Jan. 19 lasts for six weeks and includes a limited exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, increased aid into Gaza, and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave. â–

CAIRO, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres held a phone conversation on Friday, during which they affirmed their rejection of displacing Palestinians from Gaza.
According to a statement by the Egyptian Presidency, the two called for expediting Gaza's reconstruction, rejected any attempt to relocate Palestinians, and urged global efforts to ensure that the Palestinians remain in their land.
They said that the two-state solution, with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the 1967 borders, is the only way to achieve sustainable peace and desired stability in the Middle East, the statement showed.
They also agreed on the central role of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and the need for coordinated global efforts to support the UNRWA to carry out its tasks in accordance with relevant UN resolutions, the statement showed.

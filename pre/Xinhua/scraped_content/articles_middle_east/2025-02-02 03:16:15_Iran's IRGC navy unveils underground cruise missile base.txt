TEHRAN, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy has unveiled an underground base accommodating "hundreds" of homegrown anti-destroyer cruise missiles with operational ranges of up to over 1,000 km.
State-run IRIB TV reported on Saturday that the base was unveiled during a visit by IRGC's Chief Commander Hossein Salami to monitor the combat preparedness level of the naval forces' missile units.
The report said the missiles could be fired from the underground base, rather than brought to the ground.
Among the weapons stored in the base was the "Qadr-380" precision-guided cruise missile, which was unveiled for the first time. According to IRIB TV, IRGC Navy's Commander Alireza Tangsiri said the missile could hit targets within a range of over 1,000 km and possessed anti-jamming capabilities.
According to the report, Salami said the display is intended to "increase the accuracy of the enemies' calculations (about Iran's power) and prevent them from making mistakes that would trouble themselves and others."
The base is on the southern coasts of Iran, IRGC's official news outlet Sepah News reported on Saturday.
Earlier this month, the IRGC unveiled an underground missile base, housing advanced Iranian missiles, including the "Emad, Qadr, and Qiam," all liquid-fueled.
A few days later, the IRGC's Navy unveiled an underground base accommodating various combat vessels. â–

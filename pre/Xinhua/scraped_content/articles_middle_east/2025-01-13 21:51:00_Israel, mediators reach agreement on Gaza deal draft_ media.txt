JERUSALEM, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli officials and mediators have reached an agreement on a draft proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, Israeli media reported Monday.
The draft has been delivered to Hamas, and the armed Palestinian movement is expected to provide its response to the mediators, the Israeli news site Walla reported, citing sources involved in the negotiations.
The sources said a deal that would end the more than 15 months of war and secure the release of almost 100 hostages still held in Gaza, appears to be within reach.
Earlier Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed that "progress" had been made in the talks held in Qatar, and Israel "is working hard to reach a deal." â–

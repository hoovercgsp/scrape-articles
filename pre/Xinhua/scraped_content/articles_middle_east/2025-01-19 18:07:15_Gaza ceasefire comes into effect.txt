JERUSALEM, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement in Gaza came into effect on Sunday, after more than 15 months of deadly strikes.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the beginning of the ceasefire in a statement, after Hamas released the names of the first three female hostages set to be freed later in the day.
The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, was scheduled to go into effect at 0830 a.m. (0630 GMT). However, Netanyahu ordered the military to continue the assault, vowing not to cease fighting until Hamas provided the list of hostages.
In a statement, Hamas reaffirmed its commitment to the deal but said the delay of providing the list was due to technical reasons.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it conducted artillery and airstrikes in several locations across Gaza. Palestinian health authorities reported at least eight people were killed in the attacks. â–

CAIRO, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Monday for talks over the development of the ongoing Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement in Gaza, an Egyptian security source told Xinhua.
The negotiations will focus on the new batch of Palestinian prisoners who will be released on Saturday in exchange for the release of three Israeli hostages, the anonymous source said.
The release of Israeli female hostage Arbel Yehud, who is expected to be released on Wednesday or Thursday, will also be discussed, the source added.
Efforts to consolidate the ceasefire in Gaza will also be discussed, according to the source.
Earlier in the day, Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement to release six Israeli hostages this week and allow displaced Gaza residents to return from southern to northern areas of the strip.
Yehud and two others will be released before Friday and three more hostages will be released on Saturday by Hamas, Majed Al Ansari, spokesperson of Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on X.
"Additionally, Israel will provide a list of 400 individuals detained since Oct. 7, 2023, every Sunday during the first phase of the agreement," Al Ansari added.
On Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced the completion of the second phase of a prisoner-hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel, implemented under the initial terms of a ceasefire agreement.
The first stage of the six-week ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. â–

GAZA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- A source from the political bureau of Hamas said on Monday that the movement is ready to engage in indirect negotiations with Israel to implement the second phase of the ceasefire and a potential prisoner-for-hostage exchange.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "Hamas has fulfilled all the terms of the agreement and is ready to start indirect negotiations with Israel to finalize the second phase, which aims to ease the suffering of our people."
Under the three-phase ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas last month, negotiations on implementing the second phase were to begin before the 16th day of phase one, which falls on Monday.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Washington on Sunday to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. Media reports indicated that Netanyahu decided to delay sending a negotiation team to Qatar for talks on the second phase until after his meeting with Trump.
Since the truce took effect on Jan. 19, Hamas has released 18 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinians from its prisons. â–

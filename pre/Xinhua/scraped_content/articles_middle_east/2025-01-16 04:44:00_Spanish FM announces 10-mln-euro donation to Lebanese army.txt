BEIRUT, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares Bueno announced here on Wednesday that Spain will donate 10 million euros to the Lebanese Armed Forces.
Bueno made the announcement after he met with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun at Baabda Palace in Lebanon's capital Beirut, according to a statement by the Lebanese presidency.
The visiting Spanish minister said his country would continue to support Lebanon in securing stability and facilitating humanitarian response, especially through aiding the army and participating in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
He said that the 10 million euros would be used to pay salaries and provide logistic support for the army.
Bueno said his country condemns all attacks against civilians and infrastructure and supports the deployment of the Lebanese army south of the Litani River for the safety of both Lebanese and Israeli citizens.
He also noted that Spain would assist in rebuilding Lebanon, which has recently emerged from a 14-month deadly conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
The top Spanish diplomat also extended an invitation to Aoun to visit Spain. â–

TEHRAN, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that his country seeks peace, not fight or war, while rebuffing external threats, reported the official news agency IRNA.
He made the remarks at a meeting with a number of elites in Iran's southwestern Khuzestan province while elaborating on his administration's foreign policy.
Pezeshkian said Iran wants to live in peace and tranquility with the world as neighboring states are prioritized in Iran's foreign policy.
"We should speak to the world in the language of peace, health and righteousness, not by fighting with everyone," he said.
Pezeshkian said Iran should have relations with all sides based on the three principles of "dignity, expediency and wisdom," except Israel, "which is an aggressor and has shown that it does not value humanity at all."
He emphasized that Iran would not kneel before the enemies' threats and sanctions.
Tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. â–

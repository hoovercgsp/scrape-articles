DAMASCUS, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani arrived in Damascus on Thursday, marking a significant moment in the flurry of high-level diplomatic visits to Syria since the fall of the previous government in December 2024, Syrian state television reported.
The Qatari Foreign Ministry described the visit as a reaffirmation of Doha's "longstanding position of supporting our Syrian brothers."
Meanwhile, Syria's de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, hosted Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares Bueno in the capital. The simultaneous visits highlight Damascus's intensified efforts to rebuild international ties and secure foreign backing as the interim administration navigates the country's ongoing transition.
Qatar, a regional power that severed relations with Syria's former government during the decade-long conflict, has joined a growing number of states re-engaging with Damascus. These diplomatic overtures signal a shift in regional dynamics as Syria works to reestablish its presence on the global stage. â–

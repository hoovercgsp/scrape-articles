AMMAN/BAGHDAD, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned the Israeli raid on the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
Ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah stressed the Kingdom's strong rejection and denunciation of the Israeli forces' violations of international laws and their obligations as an occupying power, according to a statement issued by the ministry.
Qudah emphasized the need for the international community to compel Israel to respect international humanitarian law, halt escalation in the occupied West Bank, ensure calm in the Palestinian territories, and prevent the situation from deteriorating further, which he said could threaten the security of the entire region.
Also on Thursday, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry condemned the ongoing Israeli attacks in Jenin, saying they constitute a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.
In a statement, the ministry called on "the international community, especially the Security Council, to assume its responsibilities to stop these violations, protect the Palestinian people, and ensure security and stability in the region."
For the past three days, the Israeli army has been conducting a large-scale military operation in Jenin and its surrounding refugee camp, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens of others, according to figures released by the Israeli military and official Palestinian news agency WAFA. â–

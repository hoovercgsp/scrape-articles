JERUSALEM, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- About 40 Jewish settlers attacked a Palestinian family near Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, injuring four people, Israeli army radio reported on Friday.
The settlers, from an illegal outpost, used dogs, clubs, and pepper spray in the assault, the station said. No arrests were made, according to the radio.
Palestinian sources said 15 sheep were poisoned during the attack. The Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported a higher number of injuries, saying 15 members of the Shallaldeh family were wounded, five of whom were taken to hospital.
WAFA also said the assailants set fire to two vehicles, vandalized several others, and damaged solar panels, tents, and barracks in the area.

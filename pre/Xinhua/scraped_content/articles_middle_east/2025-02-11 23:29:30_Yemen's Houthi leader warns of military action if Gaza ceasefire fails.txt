ADEN, Yemen, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned on Tuesday that his group is prepared to resume military operations against Israel if it breaches the Gaza ceasefire.
In a televised address, al-Houthi emphasized the need for Arab and Islamic unity against U.S. policies in the region and condemned any plans to displace Palestinians. He stated, "The current stage must be a stage of Arab and Islamic unity," and criticized "American madness through the plan to displace the people of Gaza."
He urged Arab nations to reject U.S. influence, declaring, "This is an opportunity for the Arab countries to say 'No to America' and to get out of the house of American obedience."
The Houthi movement, which controls large swathes of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, has previously targeted vessels in the Red Sea, actions it describes as solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The 42-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect on Jan. 19, with Israel agreeing to withdraw its forces from the area.
As the truce reaches its midpoint, negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States aim to determine whether it will continue into a second phase, potentially involving the release of more hostages and Palestinian detainees. â–

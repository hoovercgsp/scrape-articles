JERUSALEM, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday in a statement that it has intercepted a missile launched from Yemen towards central Israel.
Following the launch, air defense sirens were activated in large areas at 10:18 a.m. local time (0818 GMT), including Tel Aviv in central Israel and Jerusalem, sending millions of residents to protected spaces.
Israel's national emergency service Magen David Adom said there were no reports of casualties, except for panic attacks and people bruised on their way to shelter.
Due to the launch, Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv was temporarily closed to takeoffs and landings.
It was announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas had reached a ceasefire-for-hostage release deal following intensive mediation efforts by Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
The ceasefire, approved by Israel and Hamas and set to take effect Sunday at 8:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT), includes an initial 42-day phase, during which more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza will halt, and 33 hostages held in Gaza will be released in exchange for the release of 735 Palestinian prisoners.
On Thursday, Yemen's Houthi group's leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, said his group would continue launching attacks against Israel if strikes continue on Gaza. â–

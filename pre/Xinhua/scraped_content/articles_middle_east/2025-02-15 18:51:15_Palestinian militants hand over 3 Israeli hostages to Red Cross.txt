GAZA/JERUSALEM, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Saturday handed over three Israeli hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Khan Younis in southern Gaza Strip, as part of the sixth batch of the first phase of their ceasefire agreement.
The three hostages, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn, were kidnapped in the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
This was part of the sixth prisoner and hostage swap between Palestinian militants and Israel in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, with Israel expected to release 369 Palestinian prisoners later on Saturday.
Among them, 333 will be returned to Gaza, 10 others sent back to their homes in the West Bank and one released in East Jerusalem, while the remaining 25 sentenced to life imprisonment will either be deported to Gaza or sent abroad via Egypt. â–

BEIRUT, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's army chief Joseph Aoun was elected president in the second round of the presidential vote held on Thursday, local media reported.
Aoun obtained 99 votes in the second round of the electoral session, which was attended by 128 members of parliament, Lebanese TV channel Al Jadeed reported. His victory marks the end of more than two years of presidential vacancy in Lebanon.
Aoun failed to win a two-thirds majority, or 86 votes, in the first round of the session, compelling the parliament to adjourn for two hours before proceeding to a second round, where a simple majority of 65 votes was sufficient for victory. â–

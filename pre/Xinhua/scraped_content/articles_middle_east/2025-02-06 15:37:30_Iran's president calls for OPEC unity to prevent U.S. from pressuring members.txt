TEHRAN, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday urged the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to unite and consistently prevent the United States from pressuring any of them.
"The OPEC members should act in a way so that their measures do not harm another member. I believe that if the OPEC members act unitedly and consistently, the United States will not be able to sanction and place one of them under pressure," Pezeshkian said during a meeting with OPEC Secretary-General Haitham Al Ghais in Tehran.
A statement from his office said that during the meeting, Pezeshkian emphasized the "great" importance of arriving at a common language, attitude and policy of the OPEC members, calling for efforts to keep the organization away from politicization.
For his part, Al Ghais praised Iran for its "constructive" role in the organization, noting that as a founding member, the country has always played a "positive" role in OPEC.
Al Ghais said OPEC has always sought to enhance cooperation among its members to guarantee their collective interests, highlighting the great importance of such collaboration. â–

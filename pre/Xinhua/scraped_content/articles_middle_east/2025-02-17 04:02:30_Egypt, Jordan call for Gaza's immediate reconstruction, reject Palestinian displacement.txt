CAIRO, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II emphasized on Sunday the necessity of immediately starting the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, without displacing the Palestinians from their land.
During a meeting in the Egyptian capital Cairo, they reiterated that the establishment of an independent Palestinian State along the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, remains the only guarantee for achieving lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.
The crown prince of Jordan confirmed his country's support for Egypt's efforts to develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza, while ensuring the Palestinians remain on their land.
He also reaffirmed Jordan's support for the upcoming Emergency Arab Summit on the Palestinian issue, hosted by Egypt, emphasizing the imperative for an Arab consensus on this matter.
Sisi and the crown prince warned against the dangers of the ongoing escalation in the West Bank and the attacks on Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem.
The meeting also discussed the situation in Syria, with both countries emphasizing their commitment to Syria's unity, stability, and territorial integrity. â–

ISTANBUL, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police have detained two men suspected of being senior members of Al-Qaeda in Istanbul, local media reported on Friday.
Acting on intelligence, counter-terrorism police tracked the suspects, aged 45 and 51, to a basement in a five-story building in the Avcilar district, broadcaster NTV reported. The operation took place on Tuesday.
The men, identified as brothers wanted since 2018 for alleged involvement in Al-Qaeda's network in Türkiye, were brought before a court on Wednesday and subsequently jailed, according to the report.
Investigators believe the suspects had received orders from Al-Qaeda, with authorities now scrutinizing their communications and contacts, NTV said. ■

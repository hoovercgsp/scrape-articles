TEHRAN, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday staged a drill on the Sea of Oman along the shores of the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
The maritime exercise, codenamed "Mohammad Rasulullah-3," kicked off the coast of Chabahar County, and was attended by Iranian Police Chief Ahmad-Reza Radan, and provincial military and law enforcement commanders, the report said.
It involved several border guard units and armed forces stationed in the province, and featured a parade by coastguard and private vessels, the report said.
According to Tasnim, the drill was to enhance Iran's coastguards' readiness and combat capabilities, improve coordination between the country's coastguards and border guards, and bolster security along the maritime borders of the province. â–

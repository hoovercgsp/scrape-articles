BEIRUT, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Ministry of Health said on Tuesday that the death toll from three days of Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon has risen to 25, with 160 others wounded.
In a statement, the ministry's Public Health Emergency Operations Center reported that one person was killed and 26 others injured during the Israeli attacks on Monday.
The injured were spread across five villages in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon: Adaisseh, Bani Hayyan, Burj Al-Muluk, Houla, and Kafr Kila.
Since early Sunday, hundreds of Lebanese residents have gathered at the outskirts of their border villages, marching toward their homes by car and on foot, bypassing Lebanese army checkpoints and Israeli-imposed earth barriers.
However, Israeli forces opened fire on the returning civilians, further escalating tensions along the border.
These developments come despite the ongoing ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, which took effect on Nov. 27, 2024. â–

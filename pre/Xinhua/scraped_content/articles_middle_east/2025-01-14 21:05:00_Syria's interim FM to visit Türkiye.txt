DAMASCUS/ANKARA, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Syria's interim foreign minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani announced he will pay a visit to Türkiye on Jan. 15.
"We will represent the new Syria tomorrow in our first official trip to the Republic of Türkiye, which has not abandoned the Syrian people for 14 years," the minister wrote on social media X on Tuesday.
The delegation will also include Syria's interim Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra and Head of the General Intelligence Service Anas Hasan Khattab, Turkish local broadcaster NTV reported Tuesday.
Türkiye has backed certain armed factions in northern Syria during the more than 13-year crisis in the country.
The visit comes during a time of active shuttle diplomacy in Syria. Foreign officials visited Damascus during the transitional period, highlighting the country's efforts to rebuild and expand regional relations following the collapse of the previous leadership.
Türkiye has voiced its commitment to Syria's post-conflict reconstruction, with Turkish officials signaling their willingness to provide logistical support, technical expertise, and investment in key sectors such as construction, agriculture and energy. ■

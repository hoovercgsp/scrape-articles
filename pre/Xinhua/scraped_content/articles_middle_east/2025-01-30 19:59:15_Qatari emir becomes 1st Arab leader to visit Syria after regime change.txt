DAMASCUS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani arrived in Damascus on Thursday for talks with Syria's interim leadership, marking the first visit by an Arab leader since a change in government last December.
The Qatari leader was received by Syrian officials at Damascus International Airport, according to local media reports.
The visit comes as Syria's interim administration seeks to rebuild regional ties, following years of isolation during the country's civil conflict.
Qatar, which had previously supported opposition forces against Bashar al-Assad's government, has recently signaled a willingness to engage with Damascus following Assad's ouster.
While officials did not disclose the agenda, Syrian media say discussions are likely to focus on economic cooperation.
The visit follows meetings between Syrian and Qatari officials, including a trip to Damascus by Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani earlier this month.
Syria's transitional administration, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has prioritized mending relations with Gulf states as part of its broader strategy to stabilize the country and attract investment. â–

KABUL, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan caretaker government's Ministry of Public Works has signed a contract worth 264 million afghanis (3.6 million U.S. dollars) to conduct a survey and design for the proposed Herat-Kandahar railway, ministry spokesman Ashraf Haqshenas said on Friday.
According to officials, the survey and design process is expected to be completed within eight months. Upon completion of the work, the government plans to construct the 735.5-km railway, connecting the western province of Herat to the southern province of Kandahar.
Once constructed, the railway will significantly enhance Afghanistan's transportation network, boosting economic activities and contributing to the country's goal of achieving self-sufficiency in transport infrastructure.
Since assuming power in August 2021, the Afghan caretaker government has prioritized rebuilding infrastructure in the war-torn nation.
Currently, Afghanistan's border provinces are connected by rail to neighboring Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The government is actively working to strengthen trade ties with regional partners through additional railways. â–

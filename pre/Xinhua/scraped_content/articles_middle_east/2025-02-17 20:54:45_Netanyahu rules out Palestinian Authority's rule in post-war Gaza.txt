JERUSALEM, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the possibility of the Palestinian Authority (PA) governing post-war Gaza.
In a response to media reports that Hamas had expressed willingness to relinquish control of the enclave to the PA, Netanyahu said in a statement: "As I promised -- the day after the war in Gaza, there will be no Hamas and no Palestinian Authority."
He reiterated his support for former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza, which includes the transfer of the enclave's Palestinian population to neighboring countries. Arab leaders have rejected the proposal.
"I am committed to President Trump's plan for creating a different Gaza," Netanyahu said.
Israel objects to Palestinian sovereignty in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, territories it seized in the 1967 Middle East war. â–

JERUSALEM, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that it has approved the resumption of train traffic between the southern cities of Ashkelon and Sderot, close to the Gaza Strip border.
Train traffic on the line was halted for security reasons following the Israel-Hamas conflict outbreak on Oct. 7, 2023, and has not resumed since.
According to an IDF statement, the resumption will start on Feb. 1 following an operational situation assessment.
"The opening of the route was made possible after intensive activity by the IDF and the Defense Ministry in the area and the Gaza Strip," the statement said.
"The IDF sees the railway as an important strategic national infrastructure for Israel and a major factor in rebuilding the western Negev region. Therefore, all efforts were made to enable its return in the best and safest way," it said. â–

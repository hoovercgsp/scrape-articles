AL-HOL, Syria, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 569 people from 155 Iraqi families left the al-Hol refugee camp in northeastern Syria on Sunday, in the latest repatriation effort coordinated between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Iraqi government.
The departure marks the 21st of its kind since Iraq and the SDF began facilitating the departure of displaced Iraqi families from the camp, which houses thousands of refugees and former affiliates of the Islamic State (IS) group.
It is also the fourth such departure in 2025, as efforts continue to deport remaining Iraqi nationals in the camp.
The returning families are expected to be relocated to Jadaa Camp near Mosul, Iraq, where they will undergo security screening and engage in reintegration programs overseen by Iraqi authorities.
According to the camp's administrators, approximately 15,000 Iraqis remain in the al-Hol camp, and plans are in place to organize at least two repatriation convoys per month to expedite their return to their home country.
The al-Hol refugee camp, located in Syria's Al-Hasakah province, houses displaced Syrians, Iraqis, and foreign families of former IS fighters. While Iraq has been repatriating its citizens in phases, thousands of non-Iraqi foreign nationals remain in limbo as their home countries hesitate to take them back. â–

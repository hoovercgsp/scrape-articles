ABU DHABI, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan reiterated the UAE's commitment to Syria's independence and sovereignty over its entire territory during a phone call on Friday with Ahmed Al-Sharaa, Syria's de facto leader, the Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported.
The two leaders discussed ways to enhance ties between the UAE and Syria, focusing on areas of shared interest, according to the report.
Sheikh Mohamed reaffirmed the UAE's unwavering support for the Syrian people, emphasizing the country's commitment to backing efforts that promote security, peace, stability, and a dignified life for Syrians.
Syria's change of government last month has spurred a flurry of diplomatic activity. Turkish and Qatari delegations have visited Damascus, while Syria's interim Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani has embarked on trips to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan. These efforts aim to rebuild ties with regional powers and advocate for the lifting of Western sanctions. â–

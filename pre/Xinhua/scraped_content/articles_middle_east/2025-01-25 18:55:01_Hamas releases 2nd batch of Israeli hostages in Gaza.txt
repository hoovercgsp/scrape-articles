GAZA/JERUSALEM, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic Hamas movement on Saturday released the second batch of Israeli hostages, four women who were received by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza City.
Local eyewitnesses told Xinhua that dozens of Hamas militants and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad delivered the four hostages to the ICRC at the Palestine Square in Gaza City.
Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy were handed over to the ICRC in Gaza, Hamas said in a press statement.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) have confirmed the release of the four Israeli female soldier hostages. They said in a joint statement that the ICRC has communicated with the Israeli side about the Hamas transfer of hostages, who the organization said "are on their way toward IDF and ISA forces in the Gaza Strip."
The four Israeli army observers aged 19-20 were abducted by Hamas from the Israeli army's surveillance base at Nahal Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, near the Gaza Strip border.
The hostage transfer from Hamas to the ICRC in Gaza was broadcast live on Israel's state-owned Kan TV News and other leading Israeli and international media outlets. The four, who were wounded during their abduction, appeared to be in good health, walking and smiling.
This hostage release is part of the second phase of a prisoner-hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel, implemented under the initial terms of a ceasefire agreement.
The first stage of the six-week ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19.
The ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel was reached after 15 months of intense fighting, as a result of negotiations mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. â–

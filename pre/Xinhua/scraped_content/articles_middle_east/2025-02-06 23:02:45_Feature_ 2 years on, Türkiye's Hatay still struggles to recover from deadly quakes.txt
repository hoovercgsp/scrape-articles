HATAY, Türkiye, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- In the early hours of Feb. 6, 2023, two powerful earthquakes struck southern Türkiye, claiming the lives of over 53,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Two years later, Hatay, the hardest-hit province, still struggles to recover amid significant rebuilding efforts.
The twin quakes measuring 7.7 and 7.6 magnitude rocked 11 Turkish provinces a few hours apart, causing damage to tens of thousands of structures and making the disaster the worst in Türkiye's recent history.
According to Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), over 715,000 buildings were affected by the quakes, with 200,000 utterly destroyed or too damaged to repair. Most impacted structures were civilian homes, necessitating the construction of 680,000 new housing units.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that the indirect economic loss from the quakes is estimated at 104 billion U.S. dollars, putting indirect loss at 150 billion dollars.
Two years later, Hatay's economy and society remain shaken while rebuilding efforts are continuing unabated.
Irfan Danis, a quake survivor who was lucky enough to move into a new home last year, told Xinhua that "there are still many people living in precarious conditions, in containers," pointing out that the devastation in Hatay was "beyond imagination."
According to AFAD figures, over 600,000 quake survivors still live in containers.
The Turkish government said it is prioritizing efforts to "build back better," aiming to develop cities and communities more resilient to future quakes in a country crossed by fault lines.
Erdogan recently announced that 45 percent of the planned housing projects had been completed.
He said the government had delivered more than 200,000 housing units to beneficiaries, and nearly 453,000 homes will be ready by the end of 2025, adding 2.6 trillion liras (72.4 billion dollars) had been spent on rebuilding work.
In Hatay, the most challenging reconstruction work lies in its capital city of Antakya.
The historic city center, known in Roman and medieval times as Antioch, saw 90 percent of its buildings destroyed in the devastating quakes.
A British architectural firm has been commissioned by Turkish authorities to prepare a master plan to rebuild Antakya and ensure the city can withstand future earthquakes within 10 years.
"What is lost is lost, we have to look at the future and build quake-resilient structures to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies," Adnan Demirel, a mechanical engineer in Antakya, told Xinhua.
Demirel said that "there has been improvement in Hatay despite all odds," but called on the government to speed up reconstruction efforts.
"Thousands still under temporary housing want to return to a normal life," Demirel added. ■

BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- The candid, constructive, substantive and productive meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, has once again charted course and injected impetus for the development of China-U.S. ties.
During Tuesday's meeting via video link, Xi compared China and the United States to two giant ships sailing in the ocean, and said that it is important for the two sides to keep a steady hand on the tiller, so that the two giant ships will break waves and forge ahead together, without losing direction or speed, still less colliding with each other.
For the two ships' safe voyage, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation are the important principles.
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States, overall relations between the two countries have seen steadfast development despite some ups and downs, and have become one of the world's most important bilateral relationship.
To make sure that the two "giant ships" will not lose direction or speed, let alone colliding with each other, the two sides should respect each other's social system and development path, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and respect each other's right to development. No conflict and no confrontation is also a line that both sides must hold.
Xi said on Tuesday that the most important event in international relations over the past 50 years was the reopening and development of China-U.S. relations, which has benefited the two countries and the whole world.

During the commemoration, a wreath in the name of the top leader was laid before the friendship tower with letters on a ribbon reading "We will remember the martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers forever", the report said.

"The military merit of the Chinese People's Volunteers registered in the DPRK's history of war victory would be kept in the minds of the Korean people as an eternal golden star symbolic of feats," he said.
The DPRK leader also visited the Fatherland Liberation War Martyrs Cemetery and the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mt. Taesong on Friday in commemoration of the war victory, the KCNA reported. â–

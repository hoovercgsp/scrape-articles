ULAN BATOR, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- A series of cultural events promoting northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region officially kicked off in Ulan Bator, capital of Mongolia, on Monday.
The "Feel China" cultural days, co-organized by the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, the Ministry of Culture, Sports, Tourism, and Youth of Mongolia, and the Information Office of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia, aim to deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia, enhance their longstanding friendship, and celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
The opening ceremony was attended by Jiang Xinhui, director of the Information Office of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia, Zhang Muxing, acting ambassador and minister counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, Adiyasuren Davaajargal, state secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Sports, Tourism, and Youth of Mongolia, as well as other officials and representatives from both countries.
Davaajargal said he hopes that the series of events will further enhance cultural relations between China and Mongolia and promote cross-border tourism.

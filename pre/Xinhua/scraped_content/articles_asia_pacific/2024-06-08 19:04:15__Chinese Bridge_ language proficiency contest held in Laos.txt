VIENTIANE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd "Chinese Bridge" Chinese proficiency competition for Lao university students concluded its final in northern Laos' Luang Prabang province on Saturday.
The competition, themed "We are one family," comprised three sections -- a speech, a knowledge quiz and a talent show. A total of 18 contestants from universities across Laos showed their knowledge of the Chinese language and culture while performing Chinese art shows.
After fierce competition, a 23-year-old student from Souphanouvong University in Luang Prabang province won the first prize and will travel to China as the representative of Laos to participate in the global finals.
"I am very happy. I did not expect that I would win first place! But since I won, I will take this opportunity to experience life in China and feel the charm of Chinese culture," he said excitedly when talking about his winning.
"China also has many advanced technologies, and I will bring back what I learned during this trip and introduce it to the Lao people," he added.
Speaking at the event, Secretary General of the Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union Central Committee Monexay Laomouasong expressed his hope that this competition will further promote exchanges and cooperation between the youths of the two countries and deepen mutual understanding and friendship.
"I believe that as long as we continue to work together, the exchanges between the youths of China and Laos will surely bear more fruitful fruits," he said. â–

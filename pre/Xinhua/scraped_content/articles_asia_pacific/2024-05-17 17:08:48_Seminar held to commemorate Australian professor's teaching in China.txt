SYDNEY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A seminar commemorating the 60th anniversary of Australian sinologist Colin Mackerras' teaching in China was held Thursday in Brisbane, capital of Australia's northeastern state of Queensland.
The seminar, also focused on China-Australia relations, was jointly hosted by the Chinese Consulate-General in Brisbane and the Queensland branch of the Australia China Friendship Society. It was attended by more than 80 people, including Mackerras and his family, students and friends.
"This seminar is a testament to the strong ties and mutual respect between our nations," Casey Davidson, president of the Queensland branch of the Australia-China Friendship Society, said in her opening remarks at the seminar.
Mackerras, an emeritus professor at Griffith University, went to China in 1964 and taught at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute (now Beijing Foreign Studies University) until 1966.
Over the past 60 years, he has been engaged in Sinology research, actively promoting exchanges and cooperation between universities and cultural institutions in Australia and China and making outstanding contributions to the study of China and the promotion of Chinese culture.
In September 2014, Mackerras was awarded the Friendship Award by the Chinese government.
Chinese Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian spoke highly of Mackerras' outstanding contribution to promoting cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia.
"It is precisely because of a group of China-Australia friendship envoys like Professor Colin Mackerras that China-Australia relations always contain vitality even in the face of difficulties," Xiao said in his speech at the seminar.
Mackerras said in his speech that he fell in love with China and its people when he first went to China to teach in the 1960s and he still has that view to this day.
In his concluding remarks at the seminar, Chinese Consul General in Brisbane Ruan Zongze said Mackerras is still traveling between China and Australia in his octogenarian years, persisting in introducing the real China and calling for friendship between the two countries. â–

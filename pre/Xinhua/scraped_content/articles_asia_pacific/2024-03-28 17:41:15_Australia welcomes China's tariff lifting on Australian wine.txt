CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia has welcomed China's decision to lift anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on Australian wine.
A joint media release from Australian government agencies said that the Australian side welcomes this outcome, which comes at a critical time for the Australian wine industry, adding that "the re-entry of Australian bottled wine into the Chinese market will benefit both Australian producers and Chinese consumers."
China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday announced that the country will lift anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on Australian wine from Friday.
The media release introduced that Australia's wine exports to China were worth 1.1 billion Australian dollars (some 713 million U.S. dollars) in 2019. â–

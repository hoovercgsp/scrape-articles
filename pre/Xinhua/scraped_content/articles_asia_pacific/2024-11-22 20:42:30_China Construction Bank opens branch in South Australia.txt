ADELAIDE, Australia, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The opening of a branch of China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the four largest banks in China, in Adelaide, will further boost financial cooperation between China and South Australia, said government and business representatives.
Chinese Consul General in Adelaide Li Dong spoke highly of the important role played by financial institutions in promoting bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
Li told the branch's opening ceremony this week that he hoped the CCB Adelaide Branch would give full play to its advantages and make more contributions to the practical cooperation between China and South Australia through high-quality and professional financial services.
South Australia Minister for Trade and Investment Joe Szakacs said there are unlimited business opportunities in China, and cooperation with China has brought real benefits. He hopes to further promote economic and trade exchanges between the two sides.
Song Tao, general manager of the CCB Strategic Client Department, said the CCB, the world's second-largest bank based on assets, has participated in the first green loan business in Australia, and the head office will work with the Adelaide Branch and other CCB organizations in Australia to boost China-Australia cooperation and serve local economic development. â–

CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang said here Monday that a greater development for China-Australia ties requires the joint efforts from both sides.
Over the past few years, bilateral relations have returned to the right track after twists and turns, Li said when meeting with President of the Australian Senate Sue Lines, and Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives Milton Dick.
He also expressed the hope that the Australian Federal Parliament will actively support practical cooperation between the two countries and provide a sound legal guarantee and political atmosphere for that end. â–

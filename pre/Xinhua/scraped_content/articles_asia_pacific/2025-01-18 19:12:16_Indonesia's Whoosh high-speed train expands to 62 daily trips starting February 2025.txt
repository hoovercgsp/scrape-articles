JAKARTA, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway (HSR) service, known as Whoosh, will increase to 62 daily trips starting Feb. 1, 2025, a company official said on Saturday.
"This expanded schedule aims to make it easier for passengers to use Whoosh services by offering more options, enhancing flexibility, and ensuring travel comfort as passenger numbers continue to grow," said Eva Chairunisa, general manager corporate secretary of PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC).
Chairunisa noted that the number of Whoosh passengers has steadily increased, with over 7.5 million served since the HSR began commercial operations in October 2023. Since May 2024, Whoosh has been operating 48 daily trips, up from the initial 14 at its launch.
"This schedule addition demonstrates the KCIC's commitment to providing safe, comfortable, and flexible high-speed transportation for the public. We hope the expanded service will further facilitate access to Whoosh and meet the growing demand for fast transportation," she added.
Whoosh is the first high-speed railway in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, reaching up to 350 km per hour. It cuts the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from three hours to just 40 minutes. â–

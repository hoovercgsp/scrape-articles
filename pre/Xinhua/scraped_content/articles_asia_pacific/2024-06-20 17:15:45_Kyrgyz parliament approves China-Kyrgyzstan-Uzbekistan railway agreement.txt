BISHKEK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kyrgyz Parliament adopted on Wednesday a bill to promote cooperation in jointly advancing the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project.
The information about the bill, titled "On the ratification of the agreement between the government of China, the Cabinet of Ministers of Kyrgyzstan and the government of Uzbekistan on cooperation in jointly promoting the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project," was presented by Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications of the country Yrysbek Bariev, the press service of the parliament reported.
The deputy minister said that the adoption of this bill will allow beginning the practical implementation of the project for the construction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway.
He emphasized that the new railway corridor will become the southern branch of the Eurasian continental bridge and open access to the markets of Southeast, Western Asia and the Middle East.
"This route will be able to ensure the delivery of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan, as well as to the countries of Central Asia and the Middle East, including Türkiye and further to the European Union," Bariev said.
"The project will ensure increased competitiveness in the international transit transportation market by reducing the distance and time of cargo delivery," he added.
After considering the issue, the deputies approved the bill in three readings at once.
On June 6, the signing of an intergovernmental agreement was held in Beijing on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project.
The railway will begin in Kashgar, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and enter the territory of Uzbekistan through Kyrgyzstan. In the future, it will reach West Asia and South Asia. ■

SUVA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of Chinese oil paintings showcasing the natural beauty and unique culture of China's northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has opened at the China Cultural Center in Fiji.
Speaking at the opening ceremony on Friday night, Fiji's Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts Ifereimi Vasu said the exhibition is a significant cultural exchange event between his country and China.
According to the minister, this is the first display of contemporary Chinese oil paintings in the Pacific island country.
Through the collaboration, Vasu said, "We will not only share our artistic heritage, but also strengthen the bonds of friendship and understanding between Fiji and China."
Chinese Ambassador to Fiji Zhou Jian said he hopes the joint efforts to promote China-Fiji relations can contribute to the development and prosperity of developing countries, as well as to regional and global peace and stability.
On display are 30 oil paintings by 30 renowned Chinese artists. "The paintings are absolutely fantastic. This exhibition represents a high level of creativity and skills," Fijian artist Irami Buli said.
Painting is the expression of ideas and emotions of artists, Buli said. "That's how they can share the knowledge between peoples, and countries."
The exhibition is jointly-organized by the China Cultural Center in Fiji, the Department of Culture and Tourism of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the Fiji Arts Council. It will last a month. â–

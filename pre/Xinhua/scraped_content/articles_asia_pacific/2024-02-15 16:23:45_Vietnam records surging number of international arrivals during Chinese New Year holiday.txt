HANOI, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam recorded a surging number of international arrivals during the Chinese New Year holiday, local media reported Thursday, citing the Vietnam National Authority of Tourism.
Central city of Da Nang welcomed nearly 177,000 foreign arrivals in seven days of the holiday from Feb. 8 to 14, while capital city Hanoi welcomed nearly 103,000 arrivals, an increase of 2.2 times compared to the Chinese New Year holiday in 2023.
During the cited period, the number of foreign tourists travelling to Ho Chi Minh City hit 75,000, while that in the Mekong Delta province of Kien Giang was 44,370, and the Central Highlands province of Lam Dong reached 20,000.
The authority attributed the increase in the number of foreign visitors to favourable visa policies, proper market exploitation, and efforts of businesses and localities as well as effective promotion activities, Vietnam News Agency reported.
Localities with ports welcomed foreign ships during the holiday. Northern Quang Ninh province welcomed 600 tourists from Zhao Shang Yi Dun Ship. Central Da Nang city received about 3,400 tourists from Zhao Shang Yi Dun and Dream Cruise ships.
Vietnam recorded 12.6 million international visitor arrivals in 2023, a 3.4-fold rise from 2022, according to the General Statistics Office.
The country sets the goal of receiving 17-18 million international visitors this year. â–

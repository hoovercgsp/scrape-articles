JAKARTA, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- Each morning, young engineer Shanty Nababan arrives early at PT. QMB New Energy Materials, a key metallurgy production company in Morowali Industrial Park in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province, where she meticulously conducts inspections on advanced equipment to ensure smooth production operations.
Starting her career at a young age, Shanty has become a highly skilled engineer in a critical industry. She attributes her success to the rigorous training she received in China. "The advanced curriculum and hands-on internship experience at a Chinese company were crucial in shaping me into a reliable engineer," Shanty noted. She added that around 20 of her peers are now working in major companies or government departments in Indonesia, where they hold roles that drive new energy and electrification strategies, as well as advanced mining initiatives.
Shanty, who graduated from Central South University in China's Hunan Province in 2022, represents the first wave of Indonesian engineers trained to operate sophisticated inspection and analysis equipment in metallurgy.
The program Shanty attended, a collaboration between the Indonesian government, GEM CO., Ltd. (GEM) from China, and Central South University, is now in its fourth batch, with nearly 100 Indonesian students studying advanced metallurgy, railway engineering, and international trade. This educational partnership is producing a skilled workforce for Indonesia, equipped to advance the country's industrial landscape.
Another graduate, Evan Kristiyanto, fondly recalled his pride upon being accepted into the program in 2019. "I had just graduated from Hasanuddin University with a focus in mechanical engineering and metallurgy. Getting accepted to study in China was a moment of great pride for me and my family," he said. Now back in Morowali, Evan has become adept at operating the complex high-pressure acid-leaching hydrometallurgy reactor, a Chinese-developed technology that significantly enhances Indonesia's nickel processing capacity.
Rizky Wanaldi, a PhD student at Central South University under the same program, spoke of the crucial role technological innovation plays in Indonesia's push for industrial downstreaming and sustainable growth. "I chose to continue studying here. I hope to make a more substantial contribution to Indonesia's industrial progress in the future," he said.
Indonesia, which holds the largest nickel reserves globally with an estimated 21 million metric tons, still faces a shortage of experts proficient in advanced metallurgy and refining processes.
"This is why we established an educational collaboration in China, to provide Indonesian students with the training needed for technology localization," said GEM Chairman Xu Kaihua. Xu further elaborated on the program's ambitious vision to train 100 PhD engineers, 1,000 engineers, and 10,000 skilled workers in new energy materials and sustainable metallurgy for Indonesia over the next six years, reinforcing the nation's technical workforce.
Central South University's Vice President, Guo Xueyi, noted that the university has established a master's program in metallurgy specifically designed for Indonesian students, with hopes of fostering a stronger academic and professional bond between the two nations. Guo also pointed out that China and Indonesia launched a joint research laboratory at Bandung Institute of Technology in West Java in August this year, expected to serve as a vital platform for developing talent in mining, new energy materials and green technologies.
Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia's former Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, praised the educational collaboration for integrating production, education, and research in a way that benefits both nations.
"The skilled workers we're cultivating will play a pivotal role in advancing Indonesia's new energy materials sector," Luhut affirmed, emphasizing the long-term value of this collaborative framework. â–

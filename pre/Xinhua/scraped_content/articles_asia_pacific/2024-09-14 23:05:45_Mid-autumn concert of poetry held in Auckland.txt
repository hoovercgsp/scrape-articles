AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- The "Mid-Autumn Concert of Timeless Poetry" was held Saturday evening, with ancient Chinese poetry sung and danced with melody, in celebration of the Auckland Moon Festival.
Organized by the New Zealand National Opera House, the concert featured a blend of classic Tang and Song dynasties poetry with traditional Chinese music, dance, western instruments and New Zealand indigenous songs.
The concert commenced with performance of Guzheng Ensemble's "Flourishing Age", setting the stage aglow with melodies and leading the audience to a realm of timeless beauty.
The stage swiftly transformed, unveiling the enchanting "Ode to Xuan Bird," a Dunhuang dance performed by the Silver Fern Chinese Dance Troupe.
Later on, Baritone Zhou Nan's resonant voice, singing Tang and Song dynasties poetry, accompanied by chamber music and piano, brought the audience to nostalgic Mid-Autumn memories of ancient China.
As the concert reached its zenith, a harmonious ensemble of piano, Guzheng, oboe, violin, cello, bass, Zhongruan and bamboo flute played together, creating a symphony that captivated and amazed everyone. The event concluded with a delightful mini musical, showcasing performances by a group of talented Chinese children.
Twenty-three-year-old Auckland singer Eru Oneroa captivated the audience with his rendition of the traditional Maori song "Whakaaria Mai." He also performed "Hometown of the Moon" alongside Chinese children, earning enthusiastic applause from the crowd.
"It was lovely to sing my Maori traditional and Chinese songs at the concert. I learnt to sing in Mandarin in the last few weeks, and I am glad the audience liked my singing," said Oneroa.
Concert Director Liu Luxuan believed that the performances not only showcased the essence of Chinese culture through music and stage arts, but also conveyed China's confidence and innovative spirit to the world.
The concert attracted around 700 people from across New Zealand. It was staged at the renowned Civic Theatre in Auckland, a heritage venue known for its atmospheric design featuring a star-studded ceiling and exotic architecture. This historical backdrop enhanced the Mid-Autumn themes, immersing the audience in a visual and auditory feast.
The concert was also part of the three-day Auckland Moon Festival initiated by local Chinese and supported by businesses and the Auckland Council. â–

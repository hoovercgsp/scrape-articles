PHNOM PENH, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday expressed their commitment to further boost trade and investment cooperation.
The pledge was made during a meeting held at the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and visiting HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee, said a news release from the prime minister's spokesperson unit.
Both sides "discussed the promotion and expansion of relations and cooperation between Cambodia and HKSAR in a number of potential areas such as trade and investment, banking and finance, technology and digital economy, tourism, education, and people-to-people connectivity", the news release said.
They "also examined the feasibility of increasing the number of direct flights from HKSAR to Cambodia's cultural province of Siem Reap," it added.
After their talks, they witnessed the signing of two memorandums of understanding, with a focus on cooperation in trade and investment promotion.
Lee leads a high-level delegation of officials and business leaders to Cambodia from Tuesday to Wednesday.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China is committed to maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and opposes any words or deeds that aggravate tensions on the peninsula, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday.
Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a daily press briefing following the Republic of Korea's (ROK) decision to fully suspend the Sept. 19 military agreement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "until mutual trust between the two sides is restored." The ROK military later said that it has developed a plan to resume exercises and training on land, sea and air buffer zone between the ROK and the DPRK.
"Maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula serves the common interests of all relevant parties," Mao said, noting that recently, the situation on the Peninsula has been tense, and the confrontation between relevant parties has intensified. China is concerned about the current developments.
China is committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, supports relevant parties in improving relations through dialogue, and opposes any words or deeds that aggravate tensions, Mao said.
"We hope relevant parties will remain calm, exercise restraint, speak and act cautiously, and play a constructive role in maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula," she said. â–

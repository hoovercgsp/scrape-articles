SYDNEY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The state government of Western Australia (WA) has recently established a new trade office in China's Zhejiang Province, eyeing new trade and investment opportunities.
"We've enjoyed a sister-state relationship with Zhejiang Province for more than 30 years, and with rapidly growing opportunities in clean energy, technology, and primary industries, now is the time to step up our engagement," WA Premier Roger Cook announced Thursday.
"A strong trading relationship with China will help to ensure our economy remains strong long into the future, helping to support local jobs right across WA," he added.
In addition to one in Shanghai, the new branch in Hangzhou marks WA's second Invest and Trade Office in China, which is expected to "deepen WA's longstanding relationship with Zhejiang Province and promote further economic opportunities."
According to a statement by the state government, WA renewed its sister-state agreement with Zhejiang Province, with a focus on expanding trade prospects in primary industries, technology, new energy, and health and medical life sciences.
Meanwhile, the universities in WA also share strong collaborative relationships with their Zhejiang counterparts in research and development.
"China is our largest trading partner, and the opening of the new Hangzhou office reflects our ongoing commitment to developing new trade and investment opportunities to support local jobs," Cook noted. â–

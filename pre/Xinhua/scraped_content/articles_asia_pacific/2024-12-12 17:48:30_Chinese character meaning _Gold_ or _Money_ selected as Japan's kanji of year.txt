TOKYO, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese character or kanji "金" meaning "Gold" or "Money" was selected as Japan's kanji of 2024 that best summarized the year's national mood in the country, a Kyoto-based organization announced Thursday.
The kanji carries dual symbolism, reflecting both moments of brilliance and darker societal challenges in Japan in the past year, according to the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation.
The brilliance of Japanese athletes in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, where numerous gold medals were won, Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani's historic third MVP award, and the recognition of Sado Island Gold Mines as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site symbolized the bright aspects of "Gold."
On the other hand, political scandals involving illicit funds, financial greed manifested in organized robberies, and the ongoing burden of inflation highlighted the shadowy connotations of the character.
The selection has been organized annually since 1995. This marked the fifth time that "金" has been chosen as the Kanji of the Year, with its most recent selection being in 2021. ■

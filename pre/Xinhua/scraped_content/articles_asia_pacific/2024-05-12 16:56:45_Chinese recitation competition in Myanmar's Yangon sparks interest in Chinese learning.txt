YANGON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Chinese literature and poetry recitation competition took place at the China Cultural Center in Myanmar's Yangon on Sunday.
About 45 students from eight Chinese schools across the Southeast Asian country participated in the event, organized by Bowen school, a Chinese-teaching school in Yangon.
"Holding events like this helps children get more interested in reading Chinese stories and poems and the contestants can learn how to make their recitations more engaging by watching others' performance," Cho Cho Myint, principal of Bowen school, told Xinhua.
"I'm really happy for organizing this event for the children. During the event, I observed that some attendees are native Myanmar people who speak Chinese fluently, much like the Chinese children born in Myanmar," she said.
Sai Aung Kyaw Soe, 16, a student from the Kyal Ta Khun Chinese school, said "My school picked me to compete in the poetry recitation competition. Though I felt a bit nervous, I was also happy. It was my first time, and I gave it all I have."
"I'll keep participating in the coming years. I gained valuable knowledge and experience that will help me in future competitions. Watching others perform gave me new ideas on how to improve myself for next year," he said. â–

BANGKOK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is set to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year with a wide range of festivities across the capital Bangkok and other major cities, marking a historic milestone in Thai-Chinese diplomatic relations.
Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Thai Minister of Tourism and Sports Sorawong Thienthong said this year's celebrations not only reflect the vibrant traditions of Chinese New Year and Thailand's commitment to showcasing its cultural charm but also mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties with China.
Sorawong said these celebrations are especially meaningful in the new era of visa-free travel between Thailand and China, which deepens collaboration and cultural exchange, fostering stronger ties and creating opportunities for people from both nations to connect.
This year, the celebrations also honor the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) recognition of the Chinese New Year as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity, he added.
According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, a dazzling array of events, including cultural performances, culinary showcases, artistic demonstrations and special live concerts, will be held across the Southeast Asian country to welcome the Chinese Year of the Snake, underscoring the rich heritage of Thai-Chinese communities. â–

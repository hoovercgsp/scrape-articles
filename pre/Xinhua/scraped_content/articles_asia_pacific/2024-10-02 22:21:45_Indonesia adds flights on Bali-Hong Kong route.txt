JAKARTA, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport in Indonesia's Bali has increased flight frequency between the tourist island and China's Hong Kong, by integrating AirAsia flights into its schedule.
Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, general manager of I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport, noted that previously, this route was only operated by Hong Kong Airlines in the morning and Cathay Pacific in the afternoon.
"The flights operated by PT Indonesia AirAsia complement this schedule with departures at 1:45 a.m. local time," Syaugi told reporters on Wednesday.
According to the airport, the Hong Kong route shows strong potential, with a seat occupancy rate of 80 percent and an on-time performance rate of 83 percent. â–

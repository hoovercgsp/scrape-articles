LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China-made musical instruments gained a strong foothold at a leading exhibition held in Southern California over the weekend, attracting lots of attention and recognition from U.S. customers and dealers.
More than 3,500 brands in the music industry from across the globe participated in the 2022 National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Show, one of the world's biggest music industry trade shows, held in Anaheim Convention Center.
Chinese companies, an important force at the annual show in recent years, showcased their latest music, sound and entertainment products and technologies. A record number of around 220 Chinese companies participated in the last show held in early 2020.
The annual show resumed in-person exhibition this year after cancellation in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number of exhibitors from abroad including Chinese exhibitors dropped for risks in international travels.
Many Chinese companies shipped their latest music products to the United States and sent their representatives based in the country to the show, in an effort to reach out to more customers.
The Pearl River Piano Group, China's major piano manufacturer, set up a private exhibition room at the show, attracting a full house of visitors to try various styles of pianos.
Leng Tshua, director of global sales and marketing of Pearl River Piano, told Xinhua the company shipped 40 first-class pianos from China to the show, among which were the Kayserburg pianos that combined German craftsmanship with the latest advancements in acoustics and manufacturing technology.
Calling North America a very important market for the company, Tshua said that in recent years, the brand has gained increasing recognition among global users including American customers.
Pearl River hopes to reach out to more dealers and music lovers through the show, and will make long-term efforts to build brand awareness, he told Xinhua.
Sunsmile Musical Instrument Corporation, a company based in Eastern China's Shandong Province, sent their latest electric guitars to the show.
Jennifer Price, owner of a music store in Simi Valley in California, stopped by the booth and ordered several guitars from the company.
Price told Xinhua her store was shut down for two years during the pandemic, and it recently reopened. Chinese musical instruments were best sellers in her store, and she planned to order more at the show.
"These Chinese vintage guitars are handmade, with outstanding qualities and very fair price," Price said, adding that she has been a customer of Chinese musical instruments for over 20 years.
Shenzhen Joyo technology company, which specializes in manufacturing and marketing digital music products, exhibited a wide array of guitar paddles and amplifiers at the show.
Tuerdi Aikebai, a company representative, told Xinhua the company expected to present its latest products to customers worldwide at the leading music show, and further expand its overseas market.
The show, held from Friday to Sunday, offered participants a dynamic way to experience the latest music products and technologies, educational sessions and live concerts.
For the first time, select content and experiences from the 2022 NAMM show were shared through a new digital interactive platform to exhibitors, attendees and participants from around the world who couldn't participate in person. â–

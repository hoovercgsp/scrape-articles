ANCHORAGE, the United States, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. high-level strategic dialogue was candid, constructive and helpful, though there are still some important differences between the two sides, said Yang Jiechi, a senior Chinese official, here on Friday.
China will firmly safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and China's development and growth is unstoppable, said Yang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee.

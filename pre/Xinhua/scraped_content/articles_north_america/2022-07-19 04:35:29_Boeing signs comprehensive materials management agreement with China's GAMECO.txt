SAN FRANCISCO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Boeing announced on Monday that the company and China's Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Co., Ltd. (GAMECO) signed a 5-year Integrated Materials Management (IMM) program contract, marking the first time Boeing will provide a comprehensive materials management solution in the Chinese mainland.
Boeing's new 5-year program will provide demand planning, on-site personnel, and logistics services to support GAMECO's operations to optimize materials purchase and inventory costs and also improve production service levels, the announcement said.
The contract further expands the partnership between Boeing and GAMECO, which have worked together on passenger-to-freighter conversions for standard and wide-body aircraft, including the 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) and 767-300BCF lines as well as 777/737 landing gear overhaul.
GAMECO's performance has helped Boeing improve and expand conversion services to customers worldwide. In addition, the cooperation has helped GAMECO strengthen its maintenance capabilities and achieve strategic priorities, Boeing said.
"China is a strategic and important market for BGS (Boeing Global Services). This partnership will enable us to better serve our customer base in China and provide solutions as market demands increase in the future," said Mini Desai, vice president of Commercial Spares and Managed Parts, Boeing Global Services.
GAMECO, established in October 1989 at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, is a joint venture between China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa (China) Ltd. from Hong Kong that specializes in aircraft and airborne component maintenance, repair and overhaul. â–

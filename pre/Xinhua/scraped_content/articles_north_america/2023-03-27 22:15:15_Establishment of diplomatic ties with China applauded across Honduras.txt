Armando Vidal, who has been in the tourism industry for over 20 years, is ready to welcome Chinese tourists to visit the local scenic splendours and hospitable Hondurans.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will help attract Chinese tourists to Honduras while increasing local revenues, Vidal said.
Armando Enamorado, former president of the Metropolitan University of Honduras, voiced hope that the establishment of diplomatic ties will bring more Chinese technological achievements to Honduras so that Honduras can better leverage China's digital technology and other experiences to enhance the competitiveness of local students. â–

YORBA LINDA, the United States, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- A calligraphy and painting exhibition featuring works by autistic youth, along with a charity luncheon, was held Tuesday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California.
Described by attendees as "a dialogue exploring art therapy and medical therapy for autistic children," the event attracted a diverse group of participants, including autistic children and families from China and the United States, professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, as well as local educational institutions, artists, and entrepreneurs.
Jointly sponsored by the Pan American Health Society, the China Volunteer Service Foundation (CVSF), and the Autistic Youth Art Education Foundation, the event showcased dozens of remarkable paintings created by autistic individuals. These works were collected through the CVSF's "Light Plan," a public welfare initiative focused on "lighting up hope and finding light."
The "Light Plan" was designed to help autistic children realize their right to equal education, individual value, and a happy life, and help their families regain hope in life, said Shi Bing, the plan's initiator.
Autism, or Autism spectrum disorder, is a neurological disorder affecting one's social interaction, communication, and routine, among others. It is observed across the globe.
In China, several non-governmental organizations, such as "Light Plan," have been established to provide autism intervention, parental training, and support to improve the emotional well-being of both children with autism and their parents. â–

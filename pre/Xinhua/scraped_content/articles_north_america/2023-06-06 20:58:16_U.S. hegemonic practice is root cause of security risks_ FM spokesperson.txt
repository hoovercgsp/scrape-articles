BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. hegemonic practice is the root cause of security risks on the sea and in the air, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday.
Wang made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked to comment on remarks by U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, who claimed that military interception maneuvers by Chinese ships and planes suggest a growing aggressiveness from Beijing and could lead to an accident.
Noting the United States has been sending warships and military aircraft halfway around the world to China's doorsteps in a provocative way and engaging in close-in reconnaissance and showoff of military muscle near China's territorial sea and airspace, Wang said this is not about "freedom of navigation", but hegemony of navigation and distinct military provocation.
"Such hegemonic practice is the root cause of security risks on the sea and in the air," Wang stressed.
Wang said that China respects the right of navigation and overflight that all countries are entitled to under international law, but firmly opposes acts that undermine China's sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation and overflight.
The Chinese military responded to the situation in accordance with laws and regulations, Wang said, adding these actions are completely professional, lawful and justified. â–

MANAGUA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said on Saturday that Nicaragua expects to gain strength and experience from Chinese-style modernization.
Ortega made the remarks when he and Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo jointly met with visiting Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) in Managua.
The Nicaraguan president noted that the experience of Chinese-style modernization has greatly encouraged developing countries, including Nicaragua, to independently explore their development paths.
Luo expressed the expectations to strengthen practical cooperation between China and Nicaragua in infrastructure, energy, education, and other fields, and carry out more "small but beautiful" projects that benefit the people.
The CIDCA head held working talks with Laureano Ortega Murillo, advisor to the Nicaraguan president, on Friday afternoon, signing cooperation agreements on subsidized affordable housing, power stations and other projects. â–

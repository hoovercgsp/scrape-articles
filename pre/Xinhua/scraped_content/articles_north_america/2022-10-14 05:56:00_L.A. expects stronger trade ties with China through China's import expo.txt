LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles expects to boost stronger trade ties with Shanghai and other parts of China through the fifth China International Import Expo (CIIE), said Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Erin Bromaghim on Thursday.
Addressing a seminar regarding the CIIE, to be held in Shanghai in November, Bromaghim said both Los Angeles and Shanghai are at the center of vibrant economies and home to biggest ports of the two countries.
From sports to public transportation and manufacturing, there is lot of cooperation underway, she noted.
"A lot of companies from Los Angeles are expected to join the CIIE, to showcase what we produce in California, and seek greater business opportunities with China," Bromaghim told Xinhua.
Bromaghim said the city of Los Angeles expects to work closely with all other partners from the state of California to promote the CIIE, in a bid to boost stronger partnership with Shanghai and other parts of China.
Calling California an active participant of the CIIE, Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Zhang Ping said the Bay Area Council has hosted the California Pavilion at the CIIE for the last four consecutive years and many California-based companies presented their products and services at the expo which have attracted a lot of Chinese customers.
California-based companies such as AECOM have successfully entered China's market after participating in the CIIE, Zhang said.
Zhang expressed the hope that California will continue to have its presence in this year's CIIE with more Southern California companies joining the event.
The CIIE, the world's first dedicated import exhibition, will take place in Shanghai on Nov. 5-10. â–

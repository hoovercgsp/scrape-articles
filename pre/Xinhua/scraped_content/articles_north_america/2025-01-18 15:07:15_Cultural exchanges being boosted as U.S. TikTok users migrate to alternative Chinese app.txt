SACRAMENTO, United States, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Driven by fears of a potential TikTok ban starting Jan. 19, U.S. TikTok users found a new digital home on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media platform.
Their migration to the app, known as Xiaohongshu in China, has opened up unexpected avenues for cultural exchanges between Chinese and American users.
TikTok faces a possible ban on Sunday as the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law that could either ban the popular app or force ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American company.
As worried U.S. TikTok creators and fans seek alternative platforms, RedNote has skyrocketed to the top of the Apple and Google App Stores on Monday.
The influx of American users onto a predominantly Chinese-language platform sparked a lively interchange of ideas, customs and linguistic curiosities.
Language hurdles have aroused curiosity, inspiring users to exchange details of their daily lives and traditions. Participants from both nations are using the platform to learn about each other's culture and build bridges that transcend politics and geography.
Live audio chatrooms now host discussions on social differences and help clear up misconceptions, with one popular room drawing over 200,000 users at once.
Chinese users on RedNote welcomed their American counterparts, expressing enthusiasm about this rare opportunity to direct contact. One Chinese user, named Abe, captured the mood in a post that garnered widespread attention: "We haven't been able to really talk like this for so long, and now we finally can. It feels so special!"
American users, for their part, have devised ways to navigate the language gap, such as adding translated subtitles to their videos or sharing slang translations with Chinese users.
Though the language barrier remained a challenge, many users saw it as a catalyst for learning rather than a deterrent.
RedNote's abrupt popularity among Americans has drummed up a surging interest in learning Chinese. According to language-learning app Duolingo, the number of U.S.-based Chinese learners rose by an impressive 216 percent from the previous year, reflecting a genuine desire for deeper cross-cultural engagement.
The migration of TikTok users has also highlighted shared interests among young people worldwide. Language and cultural differences notwithstanding, users discover common ground in their passion for creativity, humor and the online community.
As the digital migration persists, it offers a hopeful glimpse into social media's capacity to integrate diverse cultures, and showcases how technology can pave the way for learning, sharing and fostering meaningful relationships beyond linguistic and national boundaries. â–

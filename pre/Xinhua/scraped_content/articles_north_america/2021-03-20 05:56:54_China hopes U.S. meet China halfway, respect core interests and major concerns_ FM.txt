ANCHORAGE, the United States, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China still hopes that the United States will meet China halfway, and in particular, the two sides should respect each other's core interests and major concerns, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Friday.
It is upon that basis that the door for China-U.S. dialogue would be always open, he said.
The Chinese side also made it clear to the U.S. side that sovereignty and territorial integrity are major issues of principle, said Wang, stressing that the U.S. side should not underestimate China's determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, nor should it undrerestimate the Chinese people's will to safeguard national dignity and legitimate rights and interests.

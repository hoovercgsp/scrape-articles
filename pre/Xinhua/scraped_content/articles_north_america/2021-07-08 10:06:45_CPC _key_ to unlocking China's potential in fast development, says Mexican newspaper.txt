MEXICO CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) has been "key" to the Asian country's evolution from a backward nation into an economic powerhouse with an increasingly larger role in global affairs, according to a recent op-ed piece in Mexican newspaper El Economista.
In an article headlined "China: 100 years of the communist party and a stone's throw from the U.S.," the newspaper's editorial general director, Luis Miguel Gonzalez, credits the party's leadership with unlocking the country's potential in record time.
"It (the CPC) presents as a model of order and efficiency for generating economic growth and maintaining social stability," Gonzalez wrote. "Unbeatable in handling crises, such as the pandemic, all in contrast to the 'inefficiency' and chaos produced by Western democracies."
China will surpass the United States and become the world's number one economy between 2028 and 2035, said Gonzalez, citing researches and projections.
There is currently a wide gap between the two countries' per capita GDP, he said, "but the wealth-generating capacity of the Asian country should not be underestimated."
China's per capita GDP was 317 U.S. dollars in 1990, and has increased to over 10,000 dollars last year. "Never in human history has so much wealth been produced in just one country in three decades," he wrote, lauding China's achievement in poverty eradication, which has lifted around 800 million people out of extreme poverty.
China is also "rapidly advancing in technological scientific development," registering more patents than any other country and "leading research into the promising field of artificial intelligence that, perhaps, will define who's who in the next decade," Gonzalez added. Enditem

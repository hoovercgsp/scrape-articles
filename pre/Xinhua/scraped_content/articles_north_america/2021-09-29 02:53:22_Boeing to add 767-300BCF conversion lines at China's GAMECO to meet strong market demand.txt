SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Boeing and China's Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Company Limited (GAMECO) on Tuesday announced plans to create additional capacity for the 767-300 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) to help meet continued strong market demand.
The agreement will expand freighter conversion capacity at GAMECO, opening two new 767-300BCF conversion lines next year, the announcement said.
"It was mutually beneficial to continue building our relationship with GAMECO to provide additional conversion capacity for the 767-300BCF while supporting growth in the region," said Peter Gao, vice president of Boeing Commercial Sales and Marketing for China. "GAMECO has demonstrated excellent execution on the 737-800BCF program. We know it will bring the same expertise and proven capability to help deliver our medium widebody freighter conversions to our global customers."
GAMECO will be the first MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) in China to convert the 767-300BCF and the only MRO converting both the 767-300BCF and the 737-800BCF. Earlier this year, GAMECO announced plans to open a third 737-800BCF conversion line, according to the announcement.
"The introduction of the 767-300BCF program further grows GAMECO's regional presence and enhances our strategic focus around meeting the strong customer demand. We will open the 767-300BCF conversion lines in our new hangar," said Norbert Marx, general manager of GAMECO.
Boeing forecasts 1,720 freighter conversions will be needed over the next 20 years. Of those, 520 will be widebody conversions with Asia carriers accounting for more than 40 percent of that demand. The 767-300BCF has more than 95 orders and commitments. Enditem

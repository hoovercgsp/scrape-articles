BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- In 2023, experts, scholars and specialists from various fields have shared their opinions with Xinhua on China's diplomacy, global hotspots as well as international relations, enriching the column through insightful contributions and engaging dialogues.
The following are some of the highlights of their insights on China-U.S. relations:
Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.
Guest Opinion: Sound China-U.S. ties will benefit global community
-- The China and U.S. cooperation is vital for global public goods offering, and for peace and development of the globe, especially in an era of economic recovery.
-- In strengthening multilateralism, China and the United States need to forge strong collaboration as a sustainable pathway to a peaceful, stable and prosperous world for all.
-- Both China and the United States are the countries with a capacity to provide global sustainable peace.
Yi Xin, a current affairs commentator based in Beijing.
Guest Opinion: The China-U.S. San Francisco get-together is treated with cautious optimism
-- The unchanging belief in China is that China-U.S. relations have a bearing on the well-being of the 1.7 billion people of the two countries and the future of the world.
-- If the United States wants to compete, it must act in a fair way. No more overstretching the concept of national security to undercut China at every turn.
-- "Return to Bali" is the best way to get to San Francisco and keep going farther after that.
Xin Ping, a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News Agency, CGTN, Global Times, China Daily, etc.
Guest Opinion: From San Francisco onward, what's next for China and the U.S.?
-- Regular and sound interactions between the two presidents who are at the helm of this most consequential relationship will increase understanding and dispel mistrust.
-- To put it more explicitly, if the United States continues to see China as an enduring rival that it must out-compete in order to maintain its global hegemony, it will be very dangerous for both sides and the world as a whole.
-- It seems too naive to think that narrowing differences between the two countries is as simple as blending Chinese and Western music in a symphony, just like the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in their collaboration performance. But I'm still convinced that it's not only meaningful, but also our responsibility, to improve the most critical bilateral ties for the better.
Diao Daming, an associate professor with Renmin University of China.
Guest Opinion: People-to-people friendship holds key to China-U.S. relations
-- A stable China-U.S. relationship serves the national interests of both countries and benefits the citizens.
-- Promoting people-to-people exchanges and communication meets the two peoples' aspirations for improving their well-being, contributes to the development of both economies and societies, and answers the global call for stability and prosperity.
-- Today, an unbiased and rational perception of each other by the youth of the two nations is essential for building a "breakwater" in public opinion to guard against a disruptive change in China-U.S. relations, especially at a time when certain U.S. politicians are starting blatant smear campaigns against China and hyping up the Cold War mentality.
Xin Ping, a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News Agency, CGTN, Global Times, China Daily, etc.
Guest Opinion: China, U.S. share responsibility to cooperate on AI
-- The commitment from leaders of China and the United States is a key milestone for AI governance, which will guide global AI for the better.
-- The two countries share obligations to build consensus on AI governance, such as data security, privacy protection, and ethical issues. The pioneers in AI should take the lead in jointly formulating AI rules and standards, paving the way for a globally accepted AI governance framework.
Gao Fei and Li Yanan, scholars from China Foreign Affairs University.
Guest Opinion: Resetting China-U.S. relations through people
-- The foundation of the development of state-to-state relations lies in the people. The development of China-U.S. relations requires the joint efforts of the people from both sides.
-- Young people are the future of a country and the world. The relations among young people determine the future relations of China and the United States.
-- The peoples of the two countries earnestly hope that the U.S. side will show courage and sincerity, and work with China to carry forward the friendship between the two peoples, thus helping the tree of the China-U.S. friendship remain evergreen, and steering the relations between the two countries back to a healthy and stable track for the benefit of the two nations and their peoples.
Yi Fan, a Beijing-based international affairs commentator.
Guest Opinion: Washington is flirting with war across the Taiwan Strait while making Beijing a scapegoat
-- What holds a nation together is a sense of common identity or a feeling of oneness. Absent this, artificial boundaries alone do not work well.
-- U.S. maneuvers suggest an intention to destabilize -- not protect -- peace across the Taiwan Strait.
-- War may have been America's silver bullet for its domestic problems. But it is a hazardous, unpredictable and immoral tool to advance its interests. â–

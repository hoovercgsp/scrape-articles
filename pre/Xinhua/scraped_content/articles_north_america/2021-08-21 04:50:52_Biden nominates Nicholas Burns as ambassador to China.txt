He previously held senior positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations in his 27 years' government service and capped his career by serving as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2005 to 2008, the third-ranking official in the State Department.
He was U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2001 to 2005, and before that he served as State Department spokesman and ambassador to Greece. He also worked for National Security Council at the White House under then presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, according to the State Department.

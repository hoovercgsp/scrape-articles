BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday that Honduras' establishment of diplomatic ties with China brings the total number of countries having diplomatic ties with China to 182, and it is hoped that Guatemala will see the trend of the world and make the right choice as early as possible.
Mao made the remarks when asked to comment that Guatemala, after Honduras established diplomatic relations with China, is now the only country left in Central America without formal ties with China.
Mao said Honduras' establishment of diplomatic ties with China shows that the one-China principle is universally recognized and represents the people's aspiration and the trend of the world, and no force can block that trend.
"The separatist pursuit of 'Taiwan independence' is against the will and interests of the Chinese nation and against the trend of history. It will not lead anywhere," said Mao. â–

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- China-U.S. cooperation "cannot and should not be absent" in a post-pandemic world where instability and uncertainties poses severe challenges to global governance, Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai said on Wednesday.
"The year 2021 is essential as we greet the dawn of a post-pandemic era, where China-U.S. cooperation cannot and should not be absent," said Cui in his remarks at the Annual Gala of the U.S.-China Business Council on Wednesday.
"Research and development of vaccines and medications are making good progress in various countries, bringing hope and confidence to all of us. However, the instability and uncertainties of a post-pandemic world will pose severe challenges to global governance," he said.
"We believe that whenever human society faces major difficulties and challenges, countries with stronger capabilities shoulder greater responsibilities," he said. Enditem

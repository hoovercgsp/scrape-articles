BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- China is open to contact and communication with the new U.S. administration's economic and trade team, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.
The Chinese side has maintained close communication with the U.S. Department of Commerce through the communication and exchange mechanism between the two sides, spokesperson He Yadong told a press conference.
With consistent opposition to unilaterally imposing tariffs, China is willing to strengthen dialogue and coordination with the United States, properly manage differences and push for steady and long-term growth in bilateral economic and trade relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, He said.
When answering a question on an up-for-vote U.S. annual defense bill that seeks to remove equipment made by Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE from American wireless networks, He said that the U.S. side's claim that Chinese information and communication products pose security risks is baseless.
The spokesperson noted that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the national security concept, violating market economy and fair competition principles, and interfering in the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States.
"It's hoped that the U.S. side will respect facts, stop politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade issues. China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises," He added. â–

WUHAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A regular air cargo route on Saturday was launched between Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, and Mexico City.
The route will be operated twice a week by Aeromexico, one of the largest airlines in Latin America, according to Wuhan Tianhe International Airport.
Some 3,500 tonnes of cargo are expected to be delivered via the route annually.
It is the first regular air cargo route to be operated between the Chinese mainland and Mexico, which will greatly improve the logistics efficiency between China and Latin America, according to the airport.
Mexico was China's second-largest trade partner in Latin America in 2020, with the trade value reaching 60.85 billion U.S. dollars, figures from the Chinese customs show.
Major products exported to Mexico from China include liquid crystal displays, phones, computers and their parts, while the imported products include integrated circuits and copper ore. Enditem

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China said on Wednesday that it is a positive step for the United States to ease COVID-19 restrictions on Chinese students into the United States this fall.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said this during a daily press briefing after the U.S. government announced that students from China would be exempt from the remaining travel bans related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
China has made major strategic achievements in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, recognized globally, Zhao said.

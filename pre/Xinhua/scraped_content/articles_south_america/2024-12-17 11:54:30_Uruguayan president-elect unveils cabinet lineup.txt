MONTEVIDEO, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President-elect Yamandu Orsi on Monday presented his cabinet lineup of 14 ministers.
The ministers, including five women, will assume office on March 1, 2025.
Orsi said the fundamental feature of the newly-formed cabinet is its "political balance," which characterizes the Broad Front.
Orsi, who won the second round of presidential race late November, will serve in the 2025-2030 period. â–

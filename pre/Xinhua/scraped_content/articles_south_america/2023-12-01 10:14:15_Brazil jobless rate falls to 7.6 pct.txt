RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent in the quarter ending in October, the lowest level since February 2015 and equivalent to 8.3 million people without jobs, the official Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said Thursday.
The indicator decreased by 0.3 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period from May to July, and 0.7 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year, according to the IBGE report.
The employed population amounted to a record 100.2 million people, the highest level since 2012, when the current measuring methodology began.
The employed sector surpassed 100 million workers for the first time, growing 0.9 percent in the quarter and 0.5 percent in the year.
"The labor market saw a recovery driven by informal and self-employed (workers) following the (COVID-19) pandemic. Since 2022 until now especially, we started to see a significant growth in formal contract employment," the IBGE said. â–

BOGOTA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers were killed and three others injured in an explosion carried out by the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group in Saravena, a town in eastern Colombia's Arauca Department, the national army said Thursday.
"Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, we send our condolences to the family and friends of these brave soldiers who offered their lives for the country," the army said in a post on X.
"We denounce this action that violates human rights and infringes on international humanitarian law and puts the civilian population of the sector at risk," the army added.
According to the army, a multidisciplinary support team was sent to "deal with this difficult time," and the three injured soldiers were evacuated to receive medical treatment.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense said security in the area has been heightened and an investigation has been launched to locate the perpetrators of the attack.
The ELN is Colombia's oldest remaining guerrilla group and one of the armed groups currently engaged in peace talks with Colombian President Gustavo Petro's government. â–

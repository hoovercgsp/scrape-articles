BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's presidential candidate Patricia Bullrich on Wednesday announced her support for opposition candidate Javier Milei for next month's runoff.
During a press conference, Bullrich, a candidate of the conservative alliance Together for Change who placed third in Sunday's election, announced her backing for Milei, a candidate from the far-right Liberty Advances coalition.
"The urgency challenges us not to be neutral," said Bullrich, a center-right politician and Argentina's security minister from 2015 to 2019.
She garnered nearly 24 percent of the votes in the first round of elections, compared to 37 percent for Economy Minister Sergio Massa and 30 percent for Milei.
"We have differences with Milei, but we have the obligation not to be neutral. We must join forces for a higher goal," said Bullrich, referring to the competition with Massa, a candidate of the ruling Union for the Homeland coalition.
The Together for Change alliance, which governed Argentina between 2015 and 2019 under the leadership of then-president Mauricio Macri, comprises three parties, two of which refused to back Milei.
The winner of the runoff, scheduled for Nov. 19, will succeed incumbent President Alberto Fernandez from Dec. 10, 2023, to Dec. 10, 2027. â–

BOGOTA, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of Colombia decided to recall its ambassador to Argentina for consultations on Friday, following contentious remarks made by Argentine President Javier Milei, who labeled Colombian President Gustavo Petro a "communist murderer."
In an interview with journalist Patricia Janiot, Milei referred to Petro as "a communist murderer who is ruining Colombia." The interview, disseminated on Janiot's YouTube account, has caused diplomatic tensions between the two South American countries.
In response to Milei's comments, Colombia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, condemning the Argentine president's remarks as "disrespectful and irresponsible."
The statement emphasized that such comments "violate the deep ties of friendship, understanding, and cooperation that have historically united Colombia and Argentina." â–

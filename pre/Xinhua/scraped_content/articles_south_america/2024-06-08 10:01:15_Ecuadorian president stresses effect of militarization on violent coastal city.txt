QUITO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said on Friday that the militarization of the country's violent coastal city of Manta had a positive effect on containing homicides.
Earlier this week, Noboa directed the joint command of the armed forces and the general command of the national police to temporarily operate in Manta to address the surge of violence following a series of armed attacks that left several dead.
Noboa added that the armed forces and the national police have recognized the "severity" of the security crisis.
Manta has seen more than 150 homicides so far this year due to the growing presence of organized crime gangs linked to drug trafficking, according to police statistics.
The military has been deployed nationwide since the president declared an "internal armed conflict" against organized crime on Jan. 9. â–

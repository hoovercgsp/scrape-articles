MONTEVIDEO, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer and second most-capped player, announced his retirement from international football on Monday.
In an emotional press conference at Montevideo's Centenario Stadium, the 37-year-old said he would make his farewell appearance for the Celeste in Friday's World Cup qualifier against Paraguay at the same venue.
"It will be my last game with my country's national team," Suarez said while fighting back tears.
"I'm at ease with the decision because I want to take a step back. I am 37 years old and I know that it will be very difficult for me to make it to the next World Cup. It comforts me a lot knowing that I am retiring on my own terms and not because of injuries or because I am no longer being called up."
Suarez, who has scored 69 goals in 142 international matches, is one of few Uruguayan players to have participated in four World Cups and the first to take part in five qualifying campaigns.
The high point of his international career came in 2011 when he guided Uruguay to the Copa America title in Argentina and was awarded player of the tournament.
One of the few low points came three years later when he bit the shoulder of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
The incident earned him a nine-game international suspension and a four-month ban from all football-related activity.
"On a personal level, the worst moment I had was my biggest mistake in 2014," Suarez said. "I made mistakes but I never gave up," he added.
The former Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid forward said he would continue playing for Inter Miami, with whom he has a contract that runs until December.
"I want to continue enjoying football a little more," Suarez said.
"I'm happy where I am. What comes next, who knows?" he added. â–

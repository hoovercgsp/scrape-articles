MEXICO CITY, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday appointed political scion Lazaro Cardenas Batel to head her administration's Office of the Presidency, once she is sworn in on Oct. 1.
"He has held very important positions that allow him to coordinate our office. His job will be to help me in monitoring the government's strategic issues and at the same time relations with different sectors," the future president said at a press conference in Mexico City.
Sheinbaum said she and Cardenas Batel have "coincided in the political struggle for 36 or 37 years" and she "completely" trusts him.
The son of prominent leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and grandson of former President Lazaro Cardenas, Cardenas Batel has served as governor of the state of Michoacan, a special advisor to Mexico's current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and a senator and federal representative.
He has also held different positions in international organizations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the Washington Office on Latin American Affairs and the Organization of American States.
Sheinbaum, 62, won the June 2 general elections with a wide advantage over her rivals to become Mexico's first female president. â–

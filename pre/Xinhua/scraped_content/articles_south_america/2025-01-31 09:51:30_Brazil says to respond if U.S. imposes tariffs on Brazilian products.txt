BRASILIA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazil would respond appropriately if the United States imposes tariffs on Brazilian products, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said here on Thursday.
"I want to respect the United States, and I want (U.S. President Donald) Trump to respect Brazil, that's all. If he taxes Brazilian products, I will take some responses," said Lula at a press conference.
He hopes to maintain a relationship of "civility" and "respect" with America, he added.
Lula said that some people "overestimate" the trade relationship between Brazil and the United States, but he still expects to maintain or even increase it with respect.
According to official figures, the United States was Brazil's second-largest trading partner during 2024. â–

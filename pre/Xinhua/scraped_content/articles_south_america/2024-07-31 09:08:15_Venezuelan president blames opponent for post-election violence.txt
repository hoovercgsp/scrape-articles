CARACAS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday blamed the opposition's presidential candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, for the post-election violence unleashed across the nation.
"I hold you responsible, Mr. Gonzalez Urrutia, for everything that is happening in Venezuela, for the criminal violence, for the criminals, for the injured, for the dead, for the destruction," the president said in a message broadcast to the nation during a joint meeting of the Council of State and the Defense Council.
The president also announced the creation of a fund to aid victims of the violence.
Up to 749 people have been arrested for participating in violent riots following Sunday's presidential election, Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Tuesday.
Venezuela's National Electoral Council on Monday declared Maduro the winner of the election, paving the way for his third six-year term, from 2025 to 2031. â–

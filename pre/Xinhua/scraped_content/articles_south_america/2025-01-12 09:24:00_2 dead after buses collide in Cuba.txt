HAVANA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and 60 others, including seven children, injured after two buses collided in the central Cuban province of Camaguey, local media reported Friday.
Prime Minister Manuel Marrero expressed condolences on X social media platform to the families of the deceased, assuring them that the government is closely monitoring "the condition of the injured, who are receiving medical care" at a hospital in Camaguey, about 700 km east of Havana.
The accident occurred on Friday when one bus driver ignored a "Stop" sign and collided with the other.

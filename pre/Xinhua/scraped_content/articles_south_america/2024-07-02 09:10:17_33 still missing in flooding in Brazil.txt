SAO PAULO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 33 people are still missing in Brazil after flooding and landslides wreaked havoc in 90 percent of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, leaving 179 people dead, the state's civil defense agency said Monday.
Days of unprecedented severe weather starting April 29 affected over 2.39 million inhabitants, according to the agency's latest report.
At the height of the disaster, more than 450,000 people had to be evacuated, said the report.
While the floods began to subside in mid-June, rescue and recovery efforts continued, in particular to rehabilitate urban drainage systems, especially in Porto Alegre, which was hit by flooding again over the weekend after the Guaiba River overflowed.
Brazil's government has earmarked 85.7 billion reals (about 15 billion U.S. dollars) to rebuild Rio Grande do Sul, according to Paulo Pimenta, who was appointed by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to oversee the recovery work.
Rio Grande do Sul, an agricultural and livestock powerhouse located on the border with Argentina and Uruguay, saw more than 89,000 residents and 15,000 animals rescued with the help of soldiers and local volunteers. â–

RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is expected to yield 306.2 million tons of grains, cereals and legumes in 2024 harvest, 3.2 percent less than the expected output in 2023, the state-run Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) reported Thursday.
According to IBGE forecasts, Brazil's 2023 harvest will reach a record 316.3 million tons, 20.2 percent more than last year.
This year's cultivated area will reach 77.8 million hectares, or 6.3 percent more than that in 2022.
Rice, soybeans and corn -- Brazil's three main agricultural products --will account for 92.6 percent of this year's harvest and 87 percent of the harvested area.
Compared to 2022, soybean production is expected to increase by 26.9 percent to reach 151.7 million tons, while corn production will grow by 18.9 percent to 131 million tons this year.

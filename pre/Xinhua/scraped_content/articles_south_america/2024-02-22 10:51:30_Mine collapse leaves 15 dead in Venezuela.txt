CARACAS, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people were killed and 11 others injured after a mine collapsed in La Paragua, the city of Angostura in the country's southeastern Bolivar state, said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday night.
Search and rescue teams continue to be deployed in the area by ground and air to find trapped miners after the unfortunate incident, the president added.

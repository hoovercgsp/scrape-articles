LIMA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- At least two people died and more than 30 were injured following the collapse of a bridge on the north Pan-American highway in the western Peruvian region of Lima, said the National Institute of Civil Defense (Indeci) on Friday.
Luis Sotomayor, the head of Indeci's decentralized directorate, told the private radio station Radio Programas del Peru that the accident around midnight on Thursday was apparently due to a structural failure and not as a result of the rains.
Sotomayor specified that a private car with two people inside fell into the tributary of the Chancay River and was carried away by strong currents when the accident occurred.
Several of the injured suffered fractures and were taken to the Chancay Hospital for medical attention.
Cecilia Martino, deputy manager of the Disaster Risk Management of the Municipality of Huaral, said at least 40 people were rescued by firefighters. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people have been killed in the Argentine port city of Bahia Blanca as a result of a strong storm that hit the nation's Atlantic coast, authorities said Saturday.
The heavy rains and wind caused the roof to collapse at a sports club where a skating competition was taking place, according to sources from the mayor's office.
"Unfortunately, the emergency service confirms the death of 13 people in the Bahiense del Norte club," the municipality said in a statement, recommending that residents remain inside their homes through Sunday morning.
Winds of over 140 kilometers per hour were recorded in the city, parts of which lost power. â–

RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the social media platform X to be blocked nationwide after the company refused to appoint a legal representative in the country.
On Wednesday, de Moraes gave X, owned by Elon Musk, a 24-hour deadline to designate a representative. X shut down its Brazil office on Aug. 17, claiming that there were threats to detain its former legal representative.
X had been in conflict with de Moraes for months over the platform's refusal to comply with court orders to remove profiles that promote coup-related content or undermine democracy.
The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF) also ordered X to pay fines amounting to 18 million reais (about 3.2 million U.S. dollars) for non-compliance.
The judge justified the block decision, citing the company's repeated, willful defiance of court orders and refusal to pay daily fines, accusing X of attempting to bypass Brazil's legal system and create a "lawless zone" on social media, especially in the lead-up to the 2024 municipal elections.
De Moraes added that X has facilitated "the actions of extremist groups and digital militias, enabling the spread of Nazi, racist, fascist, hateful, and anti-democratic speech," particularly ahead of the upcoming elections.
The Brazilian judge also instructed Brazil's National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to block access to X in Brazil within 24 hours. Apple and Google have been given five days to remove the X app from their online stores.
Additionally, a daily fine of 50,000 reais (about 10,000 U.S. dollars) was imposed on any individual or company that uses methods such as VPNs to access X after the ban. â–

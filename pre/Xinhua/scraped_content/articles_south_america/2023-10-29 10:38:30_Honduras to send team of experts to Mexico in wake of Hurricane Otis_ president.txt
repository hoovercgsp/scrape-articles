TEGUCIGALPA, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Honduran President Xiomara Castro on Saturday said her country will send a team of experts to assist recovery efforts in Mexico following the devastation of Hurricane Otis.
Otis, a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, hit south Mexico's Pacific Coast state of Guerrero on Wednesday, causing catastrophic destruction to the tourist resort of Acapulco in particular.
"When we suffered hurricanes, Mexico was there. Honduras is always in solidarity with you and with Mexico," Castro said in a message to Mexican President Manuel Andres Lopez Obrador posted on X, formerly Twitter.
She also announced a fund-raising marathon on radio, television and social networks to provide humanitarian aid to the hurricane victims.
Former Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya added in a post on X that in keeping with Castro's instructions, the government will dispatch personnel from the Humanitarian Rescue Unit "to support our Mexican brothers."
Mexico has so far received approximately 1 million U.S. dollars in humanitarian aid from multilateral banks for the recovery work in Acapulco, where the death toll has reached 39, according to the latest reports from the Guerrero State Prosecutor General's Office. â–

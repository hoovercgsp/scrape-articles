PANAMA CITY, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Panama will use a friendly against Chile to finalize preparations for the final stage of the CONCACAF Nations League, manager Thomas Christiansen said on Wednesday.
Saturday's clash at Estadio Nacional in Chilean capital Santiago will serve as a warmup for Panama's semifinal duel with the United States on March 20.
The winner of that match will earn the right to play either Canada or Mexico in the final three days later.
"It's going to be a very demanding game," Christiansen told reporters. "We have to be very focused and make sure that we stick to our game plan."
"We are going to be well prepared. Playing against a team like Chile, which has so many experienced international players, will be a nice test for us," he added.
The last time Panama and Chile met was during the 2016 Copa America in the United States, when Chile prevailed 4-2.
Chile boss Ricardo Gareca will also use the friendly to fine-tune his squad ahead of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Ecuador on March 20 and 25, respectively.
"I hope that we have more personality on the pitch so that we can put into practice the way we want to play," Christiansen said. "We are going to face a team that is going to make things difficult and will not make it easy for us to dictate terms." â–

BUENOS AIRES, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's central bank announced the circulation of a new 10,000-peso bill (about 11 U.S. dollars) on Tuesday, the largest denomination ever printed in the South American country.
The bill, carrying the images of independence figures General Manuel Belgrano and Maria Remedios del Valle, aims to make it easier for Argentines to pay for goods and services without having to carry huge amounts of cash, given the country's high inflation rate.
According to the bank, the banknote "will facilitate transactions between users, make the logistics of the financial system more efficient and significantly reduce the costs of acquiring finished banknotes."
An even larger 20,000-peso (about 23 U.S. dollars) bill is expected to enter into circulation in the last quarter of the year, the bank said. â–

MEXICO CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico on Friday denounced Ecuador's police raid on its embassy in Quito in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the Mexican Foreign Ministry.
The letter, which denounces "the serious violations incurred by the Republic of Ecuador on April 5," was delivered by Mexico's permanent representative to the UN Hector Vasconcelos, through the organization's deputy secretary general for Legal Affairs, said the ministry in a statement.
Ecuadorian police stormed Mexico's embassy in Quito to arrest former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas, just hours after Mexico granted him political asylum, prompting Mexico to sever ties with the country. â–

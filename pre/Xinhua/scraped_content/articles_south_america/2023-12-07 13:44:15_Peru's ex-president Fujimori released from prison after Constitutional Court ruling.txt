LIMA, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- Peru's former president Alberto Fujimori left prison Wednesday, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity, after the Constitutional Court (TC) issued a resolution on Tuesday ordering his "immediate release."
Fujimori walked out of the black gates of Barbadillo Prison, located in Lima's Ate district, at 6:30 p.m. local time (2330 GMT), and was met by his family members Keiko and Kenji Fujimori.
Shortly before his release, the National Penitentiary Institute confirmed via social media that "in compliance with the TC ruling that provides for the immediate release of the inmate Alberto Fujimori, and after processing the document in accordance with internal protocols, it will proceed with the execution of the release." â–

CARACAS, Feb. 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 864 people have been "voluntarily" evacuated from an area where a mine recently collapsed in southern Venezuela, the head of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces' Strategic Operational Command, Domingo Hernandez Larez, said Thursday.
The "Bulla Loca" mine collapsed on Feb. 20, killing at least 16 people and injuring 36, according to official report.
Referring to the latest evacuations, Hernandez Larez said via social media platform X that the residents understood "that the ecological damage to nature is irreversible and detrimental to health."
The official confirmed that the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and "competent entities in environmental and human rights matters are deployed in the states of Amazonas and Bolivar to combat illegal mining."
Both states are rich in minerals like gold, attracting many illegal miners.
A day earlier, Hernandez Larez said that as part of the "great strategic operation" Bolivarian Shield to combat illegal mining, the Armed Forces "are deployed in all border perimeters and protected areas" of the country. â–

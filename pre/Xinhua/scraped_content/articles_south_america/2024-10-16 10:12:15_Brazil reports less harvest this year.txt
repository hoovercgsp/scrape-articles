RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is expected this year to yield 295.1 million tons of cereals, legumes and oilseeds, 6.4 percent less than in 2023, the state-run Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said Tuesday.
The IBGE report added that Brazil planted 78.7 million hectares of land in 2024, up by 1.1 percent from 2023.
Rice, corn and soybeans, Brazil's three main agricultural products, will together account for 91.2 percent of the total and 87.2 percent of the land cultivated, said the IBGE.
Brazil's coffee output this year is projected to reach 3.5 million tons or 58.8 million 60-kg sacks. â–

CARACAS, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government on Monday expressed strong condemnation of the latest Israeli airstrike against the international airport in Damascus, the capital of Syria.
The Foreign Ministry of Venezuela issued an official statement, in which it described the Israeli action as "generating political and military tension in the Middle East."
The Israeli missile attack against the Syrian infrastructure took place on Sunday afternoon and left the airport temporarily out of operation.
"Diplomacy of peace is the only path and destiny of humanity," reiterated the Venezuelan government, regarding the fight against all forms of violence.
Since the intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the South American country has called for an immediate ceasefire and for allowing the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
Venezuela has also reiterated its position in favor of compliance with United Nations resolutions on a two-state solution and the guarantee of an independent Palestinian state. â–

SANTIAGO, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Chile's economy entered 2024 on a "more positive note" compared to 2023, local media said Thursday, citing the president of Chile's Central Bank, Rosanna Costa.
Addressing a gathering of the Association of Economic and Finance Journalists on Wednesday, Costa said the South American country "has managed to significantly reduce" inflation and the central bank forecast it will hit the target rate of 3 percent in the second half of the year.
"Without a doubt, good news for families, companies and the economy in general," said Costa, adding there is "still work to be done."
Costa stressed that 2024 will be a year marked by a monetary policy to combat inflation and a financial policy for the development of new instruments.
The central bank's preliminary economic report, released Jan. 2, projected the economy saw 1.2 percent growth in November 2023 year on year.
Chile accumulated inflation of 4.5 percent between January and November 2023, as announced this week by the National Institute of Statistics (INE).
The South American country saw 12.8 percent inflation in 2022 amid an economic crisis that pushed the rate to its highest level in three decades. â–

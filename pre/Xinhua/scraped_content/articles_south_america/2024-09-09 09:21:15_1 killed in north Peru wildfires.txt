LIMA, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed and 16 others treated for smoke inhalation as wildfires raged in northern Peru's Lambayeque region, local authorities said Sunday.
The fatal victim, a 40-year-old female farmer in the town of Incahuasi, suffered burns all over her body, according to Radio Programas del Peru, a radio and television broadcasting company in Peru.
She had been rushed to the local clinic but succumbed to her severe injuries. Several locals were treated for smoke inhalation and later discharged, as they were "out of danger," the network reported.
Peru's National Meteorology and Hydrology Service warned that from Sunday through Wednesday, atmospheric conditions could lead to the "start and spread of forest fires."
The absence of precipitation is expected to persist in these regions, along with decreasing humidity and increasing daytime temperatures, it added. â–

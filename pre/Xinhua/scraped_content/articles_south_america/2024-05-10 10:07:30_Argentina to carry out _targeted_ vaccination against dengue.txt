BUENOS AIRES, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentina announced a "targeted" vaccination campaign against dengue after logging more than 420,000 cases so far this year, the country's health ministry said Thursday.
Based on recommendations from the National Immunization Commission (Conain) and as part of a comprehensive strategy against the endemic, a vaccination program targeting affected areas will be established, the ministry said in a statement.
The vaccination drive "will begin in stages, with the population that is between 15 and 19 years old," in priority districts, the ministry said.
According to official data released on May 5, Argentina has detected 420,867 cases of dengue and 291 deaths so far this year, with the mosquito-borne disease circulating in 19 of the 24 districts of the country.
Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes an acute illness that usually develops symptoms such as headache, high fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, vomiting and rash. â–

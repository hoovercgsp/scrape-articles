LA PAZ, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14 people were killed when a minibus and a tractor-trailer collided head-on Thursday on a highway that links the Bolivian departments of Oruro and Potosi, local authorities said.
"The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was transporting salt from Potosi, presumably fell asleep due to fatigue, losing control of the vehicle," Julio Larrea, Oruro's director of transportation and road safety, told local media.
"A long braking mark was observed and he was unable to return to his lane, which caused the head-on collision with the minibus," he added.
The accident took place in Vichuloma, a town at the border exit between Oruro and Potosi, said Larrea.
He added the death toll could rise due to some of the badly injuried, including a passenger on the minibus and another who was riding in the trailer, both of whom were transferred to nearby hospitals.
The official called on motorists to respect speed limits to prevent similar tragedies, noting that accidents on that highway are frequent due to speeding. â–

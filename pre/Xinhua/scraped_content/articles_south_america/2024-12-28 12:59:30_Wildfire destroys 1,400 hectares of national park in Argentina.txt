BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- A wildfire has destroyed around 1,450 hectares of the iconic Nahuel Huapi National Park in the southern Argentine province of Rio Negro, local authorities reported Friday.
The fire broke out on Wednesday in the southern part of the park and has advanced towards the northern head of Lake Martin, reaching an area already devastated by wildfires in 2022, said a report from the park's administration.
"For safety reasons, trails in the southern and central parts of the protected area have been closed," it said.
The report said that 46 firefighters were deployed to reinforce firefighting efforts in the rear section of the fire and improve escape routes to ensure the safety of the crew, and that poor visibility as a result of wildfire smoke has rendered aerial operations impossible.
According to local authorities, smoke from the wildfire "is already affecting the city of Bariloche," one of Argentina's top tourist destinations, known for its ski slopes in winter and lakes and mountains in summer. â–

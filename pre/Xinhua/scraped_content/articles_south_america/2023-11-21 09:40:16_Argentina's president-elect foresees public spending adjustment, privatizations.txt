BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- The president-elect of Argentina, Javier Milei, said Monday that when coming into office next month, he plans to make an adjustment in public spending, and privatize companies such as Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) and public media.
"My intention is to be the first link in the Argentine reconstruction. Afterwards we will see if I have to govern for four or eight years. I want my government to mark a turning point in Argentine history," Milei was quoted by the state news agency Telam as saying.
The far-right candidate from the Liberty Advances coalition won 55.69 percent of the votes in Sunday's runoff election, beating the ruling party candidate, Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who obtained 44.3 percent of the votes.
Milei, who will assume the presidency on Dec. 10 for a four-year term, said that he will carry out a "fiscal adjustment" to put public accounts in order, which "will not be paid for by the good Argentines, but by the politicians."
He also said he intends to privatize state-owned companies and agencies, such as the YPF, Energia Argentina, public television, national radio and Telam, among others. â–

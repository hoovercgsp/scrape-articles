BUENOS AIRES, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's government on Tuesday announced it was closing the Institute of Family, Peasant and Indigenous Agriculture and the National Council of Family Agriculture as part of a push to curb public-sector spending.
According to presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni, the agencies actually served to generate "jobs of a political nature."
"This institute and this council had a total of 964 employees. It is going to be transformed into a directorate in which only 64 employees remain -- 900 'non-working' positions are going to be reduced. This is going to mean a savings of 9 billion pesos (about 10.5 million U.S. dollars)," Adorni told reporters at a press conference at the government house.
In February, the government announced it was closing the agency in charge of combating discrimination, xenophobia and racism, which was also described as a means to "generate militant employment."
Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei, who assumed office on Dec. 10, is bent on curbing government spending by shrinking the size of the public sector and reducing federal funds to the provinces. â–

LA PAZ, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed and six others were seriously injured on Tuesday when a minibus fell into a ravine in western Bolivia, police said.
The minibus was carrying about 14 people when the accident occurred on the La Paz-La Asunta highway, Miguel Hidalgo, commander of the La Paz Rural and Border Police, told reporters.
The minibus, operated by La Asunta Interprovincial Transport Union, was headed from La Paz to La Asunta, a city less than 200 kilometers away, he said.
All the four fatal victims were women, and the driver was among the injured.
According to Hidalgo, persistent rain and fog could have caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle. "An official report will be provided when the investigations are concluded," he said. â–

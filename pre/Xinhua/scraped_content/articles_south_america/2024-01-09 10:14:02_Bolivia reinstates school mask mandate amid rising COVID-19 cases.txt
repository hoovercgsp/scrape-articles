LA PAZ, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government announced Monday the reinstatement of strict health measures, including mandatory school mask use, in response to rising COVID-19 cases ahead of the upcoming school year.
The protocol includes the mandatory use of masks among students, the availability of disinfectants like alcohol in schools, and adequate conditions for handwashing, said Maria Renee Castro, minister of health and sports.
Bolivian authorities declared an end to the COVID-19 health emergency in August last year. However, the nation is currently facing a new outbreak, notably the JN.1 variant in the eastern region.
Renee Castro said that during the initial epidemiological week of 2024, infections witnessed an 80 percent surge compared to the final week of 2023. â–

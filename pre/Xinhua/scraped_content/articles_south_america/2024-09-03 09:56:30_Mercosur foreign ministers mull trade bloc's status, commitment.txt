MONTEVIDEO, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of member countries of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) met here Monday in the Uruguayan capital to discuss the trade bloc's status and commitment "in the current international juncture," Uruguayan foreign minister said in a statement.
The meeting focused on the group's internal strengthening by overcoming obstacles to intra-bloc trade to improve access to the expanded Mercosur market, Uruguay's top diplomat Omar Paganini said.
Uruguay holds the bloc's rotating presidency. Other Mercosur members include Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia.
Paganini underscored the bloc's interest in transforming Mercosur into a competitive platform by intensifying external negotiations and creating a broad network of trade agreements.
The participants also exchanged opinions regarding the challenges to the access of markets and the new demands on exporting countries to certify their products, he said.
Mercosur highlighted the commitment of its member countries to environmental matters, placing the region as one of the main contributors to overcoming the challenges faced globally, added the Uruguayan official. â–

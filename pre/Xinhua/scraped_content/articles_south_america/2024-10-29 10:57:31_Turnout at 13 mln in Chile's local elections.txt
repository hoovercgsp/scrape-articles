SANTIAGO, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chile saw a historic turnout this weekend as over 13 million Chileans, or 84.87 percent of eligible voters, went to polls to elect mayors, city councilors, and regional governors, the Electoral Service (Servel) reported Monday.
The figure marks "the largest turnout in the electoral history of the country, surpassing the plebiscites of 2022 and 2023," said Andres Tagle, president of Servel's board.
While Chile's moderate right made gains against President Gabriel Boric's coalition, analysis indicates a shift toward less polarized politics in anticipation of the 2025 presidential election. â–

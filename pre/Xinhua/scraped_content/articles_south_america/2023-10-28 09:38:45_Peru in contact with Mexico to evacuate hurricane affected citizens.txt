LIMA, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Peru is talking with Mexico to assist Peruvians affected by Hurricane Otis that swept the southern Mexican state of Guerrero earlier this week, the foreign ministry said Thursday.
The ministry is closely following the reopening of roads "to be able to immediately" evacuate the affected citizens, including 18 members of a delegation from Peru's export and tourism promotion agency Promperu and a group of tourists.
In separate posts on X, formerly Twitter, the ministry expressed solidarity with Mexico over the devastation caused by the hurricane, which left at least 27 people dead and several missing, and conveyed condolences to the families of the victims.
Hurricane Otis made landfall close to Guerrero's famed Pacific Coast resort of Acapulco early Wednesday as a category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The speed with which it intensified has led meteorologists to consider it an "atypical" phenomenon.
Otis blew out windows, ripped off roofs, flooded streets and knocked down trees and light poles across Mexico's port city of Acapulco and surrounding communities, leaving unprecedented wreckage. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government is committed to defending multilateralism and strengthening global institutions, Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino said during the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro.
"Argentina has embarked on a new economic era, promoting an open market economy, free competition among economic actors, attracting investment, strengthening the rule of law and full integration into the global economy," Mondino said during a plenary session on global governance reform on Thursday.
"It is a priority to strengthen the multilateral system, deepen traditional values of the system such as unrestricted respect for life and liberty, and strengthen institutions and international diplomacy. Only in this way can we return to the path of global prosperity," the minister said.
Mondino said Argentina agrees with Brazil in emphasizing the reform of the multilateral system. "Current wars and the increase in the number of conflicts highlighted the urgency of reforming the Security Council to make it a more representative, responsible, democratic, transparent and effective body," she said.
Mondino also advocated for strengthening the global financial safety net. "If we are to help developing countries focus on long-term, transformational programs, an affordable, predictable and sustainable financial system is necessary for all," Mondino said. â–

BRASILIA, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- Forward Gabriel Martinelli said Saturday that a new generation of players had revitalized Brazil's squad as the team seeks to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.
Real Madrid's 18-year-old forward Endrick leads a young brigade that also includes 17-year-old Palmeiras' attacker Estevao and 20-year-old Manchester City winger Savinho.
"I think that every national team needs some kind of renewal at some point," Martinelli told a news conference ahead of Brazil's World Cup qualifier against Peru at Brasilia's Mane Garrincha stadium on Tuesday.
"It's positive for Brazil that there are a lot of players coming through, like Estevao, Endrick and Savinho. We try to embrace them and give them the support they need so they can play their best football."
Brazil are currently fourth in the 10-team South American zone qualifying standings with 13 points from nine games, six points behind leaders Argentina. Peru are ninth with just six points.
Martinelli expressed a desire to secure a regular starting berth for Brazil, having mostly been used as a substitute in his 14 international appearances to date.
"I have to do my job well," the 23-year-old Arsenal player said. "Of course I want to play, to be a starter, but I also know the quality of the team and the players we have. So I leave that to the manager [Dorival Juniors]. I just have to do the best I can with Arsenal and give my all when I get my chance with the national team." â–

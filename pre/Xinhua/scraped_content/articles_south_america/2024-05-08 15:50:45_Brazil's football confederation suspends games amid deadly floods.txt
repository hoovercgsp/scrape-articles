RIO DE JANEIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) on Tuesday postponed all national league matches in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for the next 20 days because of deadly floods.
The decision came a day after first division clubs Gremio, Internacional and Juventude made a joint request to suspend games.
"The CBF announces that all matches involving teams from Rio Grande do Sul in national competitions, as home or away, are postponed until May 27, 2024," the CBF said in a statement.
At least 90 people have been killed as a result of the heavy rains while another 131 are missing, according to the state's Civil Defense agency.
Large swathes of state capital Porto Alegre were inundated, including the stadiums and training facilities of Internacional and Gremio.
Local officials said more than 200,000 people had been forced to evacuate their homes while at least 15,000 had taken refuge in schools, community centers and makeshift shelters.
Several high profile footballers, including Al Hilal forward Neymar and Internacional's Enner Valencia, joined efforts to help the stricken state. Neymar sent humanitarian aid - including food and water - to affected areas via his private jet.
"This post is to encourage people to help even more," Neymar said on social media. "I would like to thank my aircraft pilots and everyone involved. I'm here from afar praying for everything to return to normal."
Ecuador international forward Valencia and his family attended a local church to make donations to those impacted by the floods.
Former Chelsea and Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa, who now plays for Gremio, used his jeep and a jet ski to transport stranded people to safety. â–

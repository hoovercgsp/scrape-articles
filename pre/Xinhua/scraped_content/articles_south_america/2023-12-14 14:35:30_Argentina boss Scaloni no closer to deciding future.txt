BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Lionel Scaloni said on Wednesday that he is still considering whether to continue as manager of world champions Argentina.
The 45-year-old revealed last month that he could walk away from his job after the Albiceleste's 1-0 victory over Brazil in a World Cup qualifier at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium.
"I believe that all processes provide a chance to stop the ball and start thinking and setting goals," Scaloni was quoted as saying by the Ole news portal.
"I'm thinking about next year and whether the coaching staff is capable of repeating what we've already done."
Scaloni, who has a contract to remain Argentina's head coach until the 2026 World Cup, guided the Albiceleste to the 2021 Copa America and 2022 FIFA World Cup titles.
He was seen embracing Argentina staff members following the victory over Brazil and subsequently told reporters he needed time to think about his future, citing doubts about his energy levels. â–

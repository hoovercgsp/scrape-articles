LIMA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed in the southern Peruvian region of Apurimac after the Chumbao River was flooded by heavy rain, said local media on Saturday.
The incident occurred early Friday when the victims were allegedly traveling in a black vehicle that rushed into the waters and there was a surge in the river's flow due to heavy rainfall, according to the local radio station Exitosa.
Local authorities evacuated people from the Kaspichaka district after the National Emergency Operations Center reported Friday that an overflow of the Chumbao River caused damage to homes in the Talavera district in southern Peru. â–

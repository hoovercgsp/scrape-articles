LA PAZ, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Luis Arce on Wednesday denounced what appeared to be an attempted coup as groups of heavily armed soldiers marched on the plaza outside the government headquarters in La Paz.
"We denounce the irregular mobilizations of some units of the Bolivian Army. Democracy must be respected," he said on social media, amid the unusual deployment of troops accompanied by assault vehicles. â–

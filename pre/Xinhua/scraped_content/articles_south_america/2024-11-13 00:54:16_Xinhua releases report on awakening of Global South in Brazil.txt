SAO PAULO, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency released a report titled "Awakening of the Global South" in Chinese, English, Spanish, and Portuguese during the Global South Media and Think Tank Forum held here on Monday and Tuesday.
The 65,000-word report reviews this year's series of "Awakening of the Global South" research results of the agency and expounds on Global South countries' experiences under Western colonial exploitation, their struggles for independence, and their ongoing efforts toward development and revitalization.
It also tells the story of their unremitting pursuit of modernization and reflects the general trend of the times when the Global South was rising as a group.
Through penetrating narrative and theoretical insight, the report interprets and presents to the world the "age of awakening" for Global South countries, reflecting on the trends of our era and the direction of human progress, said attendees of the forum.
Statistics show that Global South countries, as a grouping of emerging markets and developing countries, account for more than 40 percent of the world economy, hence a force for stability, goodness and progress in today's world. â–

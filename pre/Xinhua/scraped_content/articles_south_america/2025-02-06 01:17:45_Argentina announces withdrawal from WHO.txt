BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of Argentina announced its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday.
The presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni told a press conference that President Javier Milei "instructed Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein to withdraw Argentina's participation in the World Health Organization."
"Argentines are not going to allow an international organization to intervene in our sovereignty, much less in our health," Adorni said.
"It should be clarified that Argentina does not receive financing from the WHO for health management, therefore, this measure, as some have said, at least on social networks, does not represent a loss of funds for the country, nor does it affect the quality of services," the spokesperson added.
The official said that the decision "gives the country greater flexibility to implement policies adapted to the context and interests that Argentina requires, as well as greater availability of resources, and reaffirms our path towards a country with sovereignty also in matters of health."
The spokesperson said he did not know when asked about the possibility of the South American country adopting similar measures concerning other international organizations, but he stressed that "the president is very categorical regarding making Argentina freer." â–

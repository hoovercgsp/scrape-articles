CARACAS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab on Tuesday presented new evidence of a foiled plot hatched in the northeast state of Monagas to overthrow the government.
According to William Saab, the details of the conspiracy came to light after two suspects were arrested for posting threats against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on social media during his visit to the Monagas city of Maturin on March 11.
The suspects, Renzo Flores and Whillfer Pina, have been accused of conspiracy and attempted homicide.
Flores admitted to investigators that the plan was to convince 50 military "deserters" to seize a tank and weapons cache from a military compound, said the Attorney General, adding "the military compound that was intended to be taken is Fort Paramaconi" in Maturin.
Evidence obtained from Pina's mobile phone showed Maturin's former opposition mayor, Warner Jimenez, was cooperating with the suspects, he added. â–

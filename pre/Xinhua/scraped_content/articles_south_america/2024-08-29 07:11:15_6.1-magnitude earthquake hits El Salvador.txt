SAN SALVADOR, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- A 6.1-magnitude earthquake shook El Salvador on Wednesday afternoon, with no fatalities or significant damage having been reported, according to local authorities.
The earthquake occurred at 3:57 p.m. local time (21:57 GMT), with its epicenter located 70 kilometers south of Mizata Beach, off the coast of La Libertad, at a depth of 13 kilometers, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) of El Salvador said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
MARN said that there is no tsunami threat for El Salvador following the earthquake and that seismic activity in the country is being closely monitored.
El Salvador is prone to high seismic activity due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone known for intense tectonic activity.
In recent years, the country has experienced numerous seismic swarms, particularly in the western region, where up to 120 tremors were recorded in a single weekend. â–

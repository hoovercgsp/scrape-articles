LIMA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian prosecutor's office on Friday launched a preliminary investigation of President Dina Boluarte and Interior Minister Walter Ortiz for alleged "cover-up" in the case of the president's brother Nicanor Boluarte.
Preliminary proceedings have been opened against both as "alleged perpetrators of the crime against public administration, in the form of the crime of abuse of authority," the office said in a statement.
The investigations began shortly after Boluarte's government proceeded to deactivate the anti-corruption police group that supported Eficcop, an entity in charge of corruption investigation.
The national police on Friday carried out a 10-day preliminary detention of Nicanor Boluarte, who is under investigation for the alleged crimes of criminal organization and influence peddling. â–

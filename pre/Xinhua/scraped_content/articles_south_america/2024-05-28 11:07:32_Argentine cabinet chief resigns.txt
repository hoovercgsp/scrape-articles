BUENOS AIRES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Javier Milei's cabinet chief Nicolas Posse has resigned, the presidency said Monday.
Current Interior Minister Guillermo Francos will succeed Posse "with the aim of providing greater political weight" to the office of the cabinet chief, the presidency said in a statement.
Posse, a 58-year-old industrial engineer, has served as chief of the Cabinet of Ministers since Dec. 10, 2023, when Milei took office.
Posse's resignation was due to a "difference in criteria and expectations in the progress of the government and the tasks entrusted to it," according to the office of the cabinet chief. â–

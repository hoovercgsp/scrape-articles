BOGOTA, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Sunday announced 25-percent tariffs on all goods from the United States in a tit-for-tat measure after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Colombia.
Trump said he would impose 25 percent tariffs and various sanctions on Colombia after the South American country refused to allow the landing of two military aircraft carrying deported immigrants.
"I order the Minister of Foreign Trade to raise tariffs on imports from the United States by 25 percent," Petro posted on social media platform X. The president also said the government will assist in replacing those U.S. products with Colombian products.
He said in another message that he would never allow Colombian immigrants to be transported in military aircraft handcuffed as if they were criminals. â–

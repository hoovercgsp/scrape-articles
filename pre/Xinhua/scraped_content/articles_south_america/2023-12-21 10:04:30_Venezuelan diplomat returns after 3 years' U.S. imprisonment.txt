CARACAS, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Alex Saab, a Venezuelan diplomat, has returned after more than three years' imprisonment in the United States, authorities said Wednesday.
"The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela celebrates with joy the release and return to his homeland of our diplomat Alex Saab, who until today was unjustly being held in a U.S. prison," said Communication and Information Minister Freddy Nanez on X, formerly Twitter.
Saab was targeted by the U.S. government due to his efforts "to protect the social rights" of Venezuelans struggling under unilateral coercive measures, or sanctions, according to an official communique.
"The country proudly welcomes him after having suffered three and a half years of illegal detention under cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, violating his human rights and the UN Vienna Convention that grants diplomatic immunity," it said.
In the message, Caracas also demanded the "definitive, immediate and unconditional cessation of the criminal blockade that the United States government has imposed against all Venezuelan people."
Saab was arrested on June 12, 2020, by the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) in Cape Verde and, in October 2021, was taken to the United States in a move the Venezuelan government described as a "kidnapping."
His capture prompted Caracas to withdraw in protest from the negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition in Mexico. â–

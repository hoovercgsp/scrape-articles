SAO PAULO, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will undergo a new medical procedure to complement the surgery he had Tuesday to drain an intracranial hematoma, his doctors said Wednesday.
"As part of the therapeutic program, the surgery will be complemented with an endovascular procedure tomorrow morning," said a press release from the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo, where the president is being treated.
The non-surgical procedure, also known as middle meningeal artery embolization, aims to reduce the risk of hematoma recurrence.
Lula, 79, underwent emergency surgery early Tuesday morning due to an intracranial hematoma resulting from a blow to the back of the head suffered on Oct. 19 at his presidential residence.
The president "had a good day, without incidents, did physical therapy, walked and received visits from family members," said the press release, adding that doctors will hold a press conference on Thursday after the procedure.
One of Lula's doctors said Tuesday that the president was expected to be discharged next week. â–

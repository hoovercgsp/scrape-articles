MEXICO CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he anticipated a "smooth" transition to the incoming administration with no risk of a currency devaluation that typically occurred during previous handovers.
The economy was in good shape, including healthy public finances, adequate levels of tax collection, and continued foreign investment flows, said the president during his daily press conference.
"I don't see any problem ... on the contrary, it is going to be a smooth transition, the likes of which has not been seen in a long time," Lopez Obrador told reporters.
Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, concludes his term in September. He will be succeeded by president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate of the ruling party who won the presidential elections in early June and will take office on Oct. 1. â–

BUENOS AIRES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentina on Wednesday described as "absurd" Spain's decision to withdraw its ambassador to the South American country over statements Argentine President Javier Milei made Sunday in the Spanish capital Madrid.
"Despite the Spanish government having been involved in our internal politics, it would never have occurred to us to withdraw our ambassador, because relations between peoples, diplomacy, trade and freedom between nations, have to be above all else," Argentina's presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a press conference.
On Sunday in Madrid, Milei used the term "guy" to refer to Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, without mentioning him by name, at a rally organized by the Spanish far-right Vox party.
Milei also described Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez as "corrupt," again without mentioning her directly.
Sanchez said Wednesday that withdrawing Spain's ambassador was "an act of formal protest" as part of established diplomatic practice, and assured that "economic, cultural or academic relations" with Argentina will continue to be a priority of his administration.
A day earlier, Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares announced the withdrawal of the country's ambassador to Argentina, in the absence of an apology from Milei.
Milei has refused to apologize, saying the diplomatic scuffle began when Spanish government officials criticized him. â–

SAO PAULO, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Friday that Brazil will impose reciprocal tariffs on the United States in response to new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
"There will be reciprocity," Lula said in an interview with local news outlet Radio Clube do Para.
"If they tax Brazilian steel, we will react commercially or file a complaint with the World Trade Organization or tax the products we import from there," he added.
Earlier this week, Trump signed executive orders imposing 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum products flowing into the United States, which is expected to impact Brazil's steel sector.
Brazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said Thursday that trade in goods between Brazil and the United States is "balanced."
"Foreign trade is a path of dialogue, a path of understanding, a path of win-win, of seeking alternatives. That is what will be done," he said. â–

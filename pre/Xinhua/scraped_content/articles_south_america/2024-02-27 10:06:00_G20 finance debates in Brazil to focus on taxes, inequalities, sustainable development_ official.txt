SAO PAULO, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Inequalities, international taxation and financing for sustainable development will be the focus of debates among finance ministers and central bank presidents of the Group of 20 (G20) who will convene here on Wednesday, a Brazilian official said Monday.
"We hope that these debates, which will take place at the ministerial level, will provide us with the opportunity to exchange ideas, but also to achieve concrete progress in the formation of a consensus that will allow the massive mobilization of national and international resources to achieve sustainable and balanced development with inclusive growth," said Tatiana Rosito, secretary of International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance and coordinator of the G20 Finance Track, at a press conference.
The meeting will be held from Wednesday to Thursday at Ibirapuera Park's Biennial Pavilion, a convention center in Sao Paulo.
Brazil, the rotating presidency of the G20, will also host the bloc's summit of heads of state and government in November in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
"We want to work with all member countries, guests and international organizations to promote consensus on the main challenges facing the global economy and humanity," said Rosito.
According to Rosito, the finance agenda proposed by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva highlights several key issues, including taxing citizens according to their income, countries' foreign debt, financing sustainable development and diagnosing the global economy.
"The G20 is crucial to guarantee financing at the international level of actions related to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change" reached in 2015, she said. â–

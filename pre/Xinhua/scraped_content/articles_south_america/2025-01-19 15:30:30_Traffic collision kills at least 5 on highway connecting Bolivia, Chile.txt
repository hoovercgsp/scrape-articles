LA PAZ, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed, and several others injured in a five-vehicle collision early Saturday on a key highway connecting Bolivia and Chile, the police said.
Preliminary reports indicate that the vehicles collided violently due to excessive speed.
Local media suggested that the vehicles may be transporting contraband, a claim supported by the presence of anti-smuggling authorities at the scene. â–

BRASILIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Friday that women should not settle for current achievements but continue to strive for additional rights.
"I always say the same thing: never settle for what you have already achieved. It is good to recognize what you have achieved, but it is something that drives us to want more, it drives us to demand a little more," he said on the occasion of International Women's Day, which fell on Friday.
Lula attended a commemorative lunch in the city of Brasilia with his wife, female ministers, civil servants and government employees.
In his eyes, it is not enough that equal rights are contained in the constitution, but it is necessary to instill in people's minds that there are no gender differences.
"We have already delivered many policies to guarantee rights, whether to combat violence against women and girls or to ensure financial autonomy in public policies. We will go further," Lula wrote on social media.
The Brazilian president founded the Ministry of Women after taking office last year. â–

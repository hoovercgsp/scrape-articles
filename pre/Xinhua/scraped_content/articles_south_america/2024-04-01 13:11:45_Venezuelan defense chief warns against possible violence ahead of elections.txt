CARACAS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Violent assassination attempts to cast a pall over Venezuela will be on the rise in the lead-up to the July 28 presidential elections, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez warned Sunday.
"As we approach July 28, the violent and fratricidal attempts that try to plunge the country's political life into mourning will increase," Padrino Lopez said on X, formerly Twitter, noting that the attempts will be defeated again.
He made the warning in response to Mario Ivan Carratu Molina, a Venezuelan opposition figure and fugitive from justice, who revealed earlier on social media a "libertarian movement" aiming to upend Venezuela's electoral process.
The defense chief described the plan as "another desperate attempt against Venezuela" and called on the armed forces to remain loyal.
On July 28, Venezuelans will go to the polls to elect the next president for the 2025-2031 term. â–

LA PAZ, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government reaffirmed on Friday its commitment to biofuels and its plan to progressively reduce diesel and gasoline subsidies in the South American country.
Adams Hurtado, the country's industrialization and transportation vice minister, said Bolivia has opted for biofuels derived from vegetable sources to reduce import costs, avoid foreign currency outflows and generate savings in subsidies.
The government "is committed to the transition to renewable and sustainable energy sources as a viable alternative to fossil fuels," Hurtado said.
In this context, he said Decree 5135 was approved to authorize the incorporation of plant-based additives, such as biodiesel and ethanol, in a proportion of up to 25 percent in conventional fuels.
As part of its policy to promote renewable energies, the ministry is constructing three plants, two for biodiesel and one for hydrogenated vegetable oil. The first plant will be inaugurated soon, and its production will be blended with fossil diesel available in the domestic market.
According to the vice minister, the exact blending percentage will be determined by additional regulation through ministerial resolution, considering technical and economic factors. â–

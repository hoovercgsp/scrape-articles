LA PAZ, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed and several others injured Tuesday when a public transport vehicle overturned on a highway linking the western Bolivian city of El Alto with the border town of Desaguadero near Peru, according to the police.
Preliminary investigations suggest that the accident was caused by speeding and a front tire blowout, said Adrian Alvarez, El Alto regional commander.
The Bolivian government has frequently warned about the dangers of road accidents, where enforcement of regulations and safety measures are often overlooked. â–

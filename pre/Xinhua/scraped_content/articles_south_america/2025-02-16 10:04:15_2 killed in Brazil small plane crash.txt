SAO PAULO, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed Saturday when a small plane crashed into a sugarcane field in a rural town in Brazil's southeastern Sao Paulo state, the local fire department said.
The aircraft crashed in the town of Quadrahad after taking off from a nearby airfield, killing the two people onboard.
According to witnesses cited by a fire department spokesperson, the plane attempted an emergency landing but exploded upon hitting the sugarcane plantation.
The crash follows a Feb. 7 incident, when a private jet crashed on a busy avenue in Sao Paulo, colliding with passenger buses and killing both people onboard.
So far in 2025, Brazil has recorded 12 deaths in seven aviation accidents, according to reports from GloboNews, a Brazilian TV channel. â–

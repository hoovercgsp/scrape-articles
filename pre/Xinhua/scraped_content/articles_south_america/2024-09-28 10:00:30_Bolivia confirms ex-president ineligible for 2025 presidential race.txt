LA PAZ, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Bolivian President Evo Morales (2006-2019) is constitutionally barred from running for the 2025 presidential elections, the Bolivian government confirmed on Friday.
The restriction stems from the country's Constitution, not a decision made by the current administration, said Deputy Communication Minister Gabriela Alcon.
Alcon urged Morales' supporters to respect Bolivia's legal framework, as some have staged protests demanding his candidacy be allowed.
"The most important thing is to respect the will of the Bolivian people," Alcon said, pointing out that the country's constitution was approved by its citizens and "must be upheld."
Her remarks came after the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) reiterated that Bolivia does not allow indefinite re-election. The IACHR also dismissed three human rights complaints filed against the Bolivian government related to this issue.
Alcon cited Article 168 of Bolivia's Constitution, which stipulates that the president's term lasts five years and that they can only be re-elected once consecutively. Morales, who has already served multiple terms, is therefore ineligible to run again.
She also referred to a 2023 Constitutional Court ruling that indefinite re-election "is not a human right," a position supported by the IACHR.
Alcon stressed the importance of resolving political disagreements through dialogue rather than protests that risk destabilizing the country.
"We don't need to push the country toward conflict, violence, or instability. We need to focus on the well-being of the people," she added. â–

CARACAS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro condemned on Friday the unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States against Nicaragua, which aim to affect "the security and stability of the nation."
"President Nicolas Maduro Moros, on behalf of the Venezuelan people and government, condemns the new interference undertaken by the U.S. government against the people and government of Nicaragua, by imposing unilateral coercive measures in defense matters, which seek to affect the capacity of that State to guarantee the security and stability of the nation," said the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry in a statement.
Maduro regarded the U.S. move as an "expression of imperial arrogance" that demonstrates "the continued contempt of the U.S. government for international law and other fundamental principles of peaceful coexistence among States contained in the United Nations Charter."
The South American nation reaffirmed its support for the Nicaraguan government and people and expressed admiration for President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo for their "loyalty, resistance and daily defense of sovereignty, peace, stability and the sacred right of the Nicaraguan people to continue working for their well-being." â–

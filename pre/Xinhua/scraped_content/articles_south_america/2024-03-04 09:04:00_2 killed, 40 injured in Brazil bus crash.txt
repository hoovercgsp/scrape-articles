SAO PAULO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Two people died and 40 others were injured Sunday when a tour bus overturned in Pelotas, a city in southern Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state, the Federal Highway Police said.
Both of the fatal victims were women, one aged 42 and the other 70, it said.
The bus overturned along federal highway BR-116 after the driver tried to avoid a head-on collision with a motorcycle with no lights on.
The bus was taking sightseers from the Santa Vitoria do Palmar to Caxias do Sul, where the traditional National Grape Festival is celebrated. â–

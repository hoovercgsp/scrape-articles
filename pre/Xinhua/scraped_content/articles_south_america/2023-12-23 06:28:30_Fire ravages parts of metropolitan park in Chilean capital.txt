SANTIAGO, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- A fire has ravaged parts of the Metropolitan Park of Santiago, known as the Chilean capital's "green lung," the National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said Friday.
At least two hectares of vegetation in the park was razed by the fire, which started on Thursday and was now under control, the agency said in a statement.
The fire affected San Cristobal Hill, the highest point of Santiago, in the center of the Metropolitan Region, home to more than 7 million people.
The director of the National Forestry Corporation, Christian Little, told local media that there was a reason to suggest it might be arson, and "that is a reason for investigation."
The blaze was brought under control in the early hours of Friday, and the zoo inside the park was not affected, officials said.
According to Constanza Martinez, the presidential delegate of the Metropolitan region, almost 100 percent of fires are caused by human error, recklessness or arson. â–

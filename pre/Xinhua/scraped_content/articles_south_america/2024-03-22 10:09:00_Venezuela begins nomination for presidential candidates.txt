CARACAS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) on Thursday launched the process of nomination for presidential candidates in the July elections.
"I congratulate all of you who have accepted this call in accordance with the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the laws of our country, by participating in this electoral process," said CNE President Elvis Amoroso.
Opposition candidates, as well as left-wing parties that support the re-election of President Nicolas Maduro, presented the CNE board of directors with their nominations.
"Today we are nominating President Nicolas Maduro for his new mandate," said Didalco Bolivar, representative of the For Social Democracy party, also known as Podemos.
Earlier, opposition lawmaker Luis Eduardo Martinez registered his candidacy for the Democratic Action party on the CNE's website.
The registration of candidates will last until March 25; thereafter the electoral body will decide whether to accept or decline any candidacies within five days. â–

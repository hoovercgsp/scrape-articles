SAO PAULO, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Global South Media and Think Tank Forum, held here on Monday and Tuesday, issued a declaration calling for stronger representation and a louder voice for the Global South in global governance.
"Media and think tanks in the Global South should resolutely advocate for the group's common interests and continuously boost its voice and influence in global affairs," said the Sao Paulo Declaration of the Global South Media and Think Tank Forum, describing the Global South as an emerging "key force driving changes in the international order."
Referring to development and revitalization as the shared aspirations of the Global South, the declaration urged the Global South media and think tanks to amplify their voices, champion an equitable and orderly multi-polar world, and promote economic globalization that is "inclusive and beneficial to all."
"Harmonious coexistence, exchanges and mutual learning between different civilizations are important drivers of human progress and global peace," it added, calling for respect for civilizational diversity, increased cultural exchange and dialogue, and advance human progress through inclusiveness and mutual learning.
It also recognized that the new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation is reshaping global economic and social development while posing unpredictable risks and challenges. Media and think tanks should together seize opportunities, confront challenges, uphold professional ethics, embrace technological innovation, combat false narratives, and jointly safeguard their authority and credibility. â–

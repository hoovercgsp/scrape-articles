CARACAS, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Wednesday that a senior FBI official was among seven mercenaries captured in the country a day earlier.
A U.S. military official was also arrested in the latest operation to foil aggression against his country, and charged with planning unspecified "terrorist" acts, Maduro said.
Up to 125 foreign mercenaries of 25 nationalities have been captured as the Venezuelan authorities are dismantling "a foreign assault financed by the outgoing government of the United States," the Venezuelan president said.
On Jan. 10, Maduro is set to be sworn in as president for the 2025-2031 term following his victory in the recent elections. â–

LA PAZ, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Luis Arce and his Paraguayan counterpart Santiago Pena on Thursday pledged to take joint positions at international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
Both leaders emphasized that the move is crucial for strengthening their positions on key international platforms and promoting cooperation in areas vital to their countries' development.
The agreement, aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and increasing the influence of both countries on crucial issues, such as security and trade, was finalized at a meeting at Bolivia's government headquarters in La Paz.
"I am convinced that by working together we can become stronger in (facing) different challenges, such as the fight against organized crime, drug trafficking and strengthening security mechanisms," Paraguay's president said at a joint press conference with Arce.
Arce stressed the qualities the two countries have in common, saying it was "a meeting between the two economies that have grown the most in the region and we have a lot to talk about, a lot to enrich each other."
He called for "greater complementarity" between the two economies to continue growing and improving their populations' quality of life. â–

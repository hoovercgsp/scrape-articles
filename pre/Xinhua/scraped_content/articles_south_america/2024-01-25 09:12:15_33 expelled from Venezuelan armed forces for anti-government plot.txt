CARACAS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Up to 33 soldiers and high-ranking officers have been expelled from Venezuela's Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) for plotting against the government, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
They are "involved in conspiracies by planning criminal and terrorist actions to attack the legitimately constituted system of government," the ministry said in a statement.
Stripping them of their military status is in keeping with "the traditions and moral ethical codes that characterize the FANB ... since the aforementioned subjects are not worthy of belonging to our ranks," it said.
Those expelled were involved in a plot to bring about "the assassination of the top national leader," said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The statement, signed by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, lists the highest-ranking military personnel expelled, including a major general, two colonels and six lieutenant colonels.
Padrino Lopez announced the initial expulsion of 18 people on Tuesday, a day after the Venezuelan Prosecutor's Office said authorities have uncovered five plans to destabilize the country, including the plot to assassinate Maduro. â–

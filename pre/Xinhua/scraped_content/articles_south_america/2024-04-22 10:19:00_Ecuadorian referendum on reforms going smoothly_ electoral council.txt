QUITO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorians went to the polls to vote on President Daniel Noboa's proposed constitutional referendum and other reforms on issues of security, justice, employment and international arbitration, with voting going smoothly, electoral officials said Sunday.
In an initial televised report, the National Electoral Council's president, Diana Atamaint, said that voting was taking place in a "peaceful, calm and safe" manner, thanks to the support of the armed forces and the national police.
According to electoral officials, the only difficulty was rainy season showers that caused havoc in seven coastal and mountainous provinces, where voting stations had to be relocated to safer, more accessible sites.
Some 13.6 million eligible voters are being consulted on whether the armed forces should permanently support the police force in fighting organized crime, without the need to declare a state of exception; and on increased regulation of weapons and ammunition sales, among other issues.

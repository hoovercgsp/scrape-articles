BRASILIA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) agreed Thursday to hear two lawsuits that question the decision to suspend social media platform X in Brazil after the company refused to comply with a judicial order.
STF Judge Kassio Nunes Marques issued the decision, saying that the nationwide ban on the platform was a sensitive matter that should not be decided by a single judge but by a plenary session of the court comprising 11 justices.
According to Marques, there was constitutional controversy surrounding the case that could have "repercussions for public and social order."
The Aug. 30 decision to suspend X in Brazil was made by STF Judge Alexandre de Moraes, following the company's refusal to appoint a legal representative in the country to hear concerns about disinformation campaigns and content moderation. De Moraes' decision was unanimously ratified Monday by the court's five-member First Chamber.
The First Chamber ruled the ban would remain in place until the platform complies with the court order and imposed fines amounting to some 3.2 million U.S. dollars on the company for flouting the order.
Rather than complying with the court's decisions, X owner Elon Musk has decided to close the company's office in Brazil.
The social media site's suspension has been gradually implemented by Brazilian telecommunications operators, with X content not being updated for the majority of Brazilian users.
One of the lawsuits against the ban was brought by the Brazilian Bar Association. â–

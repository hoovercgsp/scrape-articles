CARACAS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela on Thursday again rejected "the United States government's intention to monitor, protect, control and manipulate the Venezuelan oil industry."
At a press conference, Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil read a statement confirming that "Venezuela will never recognize and accept" the "illegal policy of imposing coercive measures and licenses" against the South American nation by the United States.
The U.S. government released a new "license" on Wednesday, reinstating some of the sanctions against Venezuela that had been eased in October last year.
Venezuela "reminds the entire world that with or without licenses, with or without unilateral coercive measures, it is determined to be a free nation," Gil said. â–

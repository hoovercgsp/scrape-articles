SANTIAGO, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Chile reached 8.5 percent in the last quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to the same period of 2022, the National Statistics Institute (INE) reported on Tuesday.
According to the National Employment Survey conducted by the INE, the increase was due to the pool of labor growing at a higher rate (3.6 percent) than the number of employed people (2.9 percent).
The number of jobless grew by 11.6 percent over 12 months, due to the rates of unemployed people (11.5 percent) and those entering the workforce for the first time (12.9 percent).
By gender, the unemployment rate was 8.8 percent among women and 8.2 percent among men.
In the case of informal employment, the employment rate stood at 27.5 percent, an increase of 0.1 percentage point in one year.
Employment in Chile has yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, according to the INE report. â–

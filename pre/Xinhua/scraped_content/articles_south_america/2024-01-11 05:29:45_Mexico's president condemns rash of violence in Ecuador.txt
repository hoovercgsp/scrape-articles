MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday condemned the recent rash of violence in Ecuador, but said he was confident the crisis of crime and instability in the South American country was "transitory."
At his usual morning press conference, held in Mexico's Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, where he was on an official visit, Lopez Obrador said he hoped peace would soon be restored in Ecuador.
"We express our solidarity and our support for the people of Ecuador and for their government, and of course we disapprove of these vandalistic attitudes," he told reporters.
So far, there were no reports of nationals impacted by the outbreak of violence there, he added.
Ecuador has seen an unprecedented escalation in violence and acts of vandalism in several cities. On Tuesday, masked armed men broke into a television studio while it was on air and terrorized the personnel.
The wave of violence, which the government has blamed on criminal gangs, worsened after Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa declared a state of emergency to give the police and military broad powers to root out crime, especially in prisons.
Noboa on Tuesday announced Ecuador was dealing with an "internal armed conflict." â–

SAO PAULO, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Two people died after a plane crashed in a forest in southeast Brazil's Sao Paulo state, local authorities Thursday.
The Piper Comanche plane, registered as PT-DKA, took off Thursday morning from a private airport in the city of Sao Paulo, with two people on board, local authorities said.
The Brazilian Air Force said its experts were determining the cause of the crash.
The accident occurred in a mountainous tropical forest area, where a helicopter heading to the island of Ilhabela crashed last December, killing four. â–

CARACAS, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Electoral Council confirmed on Friday that President Nicolas Maduro has won Sunday's elections with 51.95 percent of the vote.
With 96.87 percent of the ballots counted, Maduro received 6,408,844 votes, while his main opposition rival garnered 5,326,104 votes (43.18 percent), according to Elvis Amoroso, head of the National Electoral Council.
Amoroso also announced the vote percentages for other candidates: Luis Martinez received 1.24 percent of the vote, Antonio Ecarri, 0.94 percent; Benjamin Rausseo, 0.75 percent; Jose Brito, 0.68 percent; Javier Bertucci, 0.52 percent; Claudio Fermin, 0.33 percent; Enrique Marquez, 0.24 percent; and Daniel Ceballos, 0.16 percent.
He said a total of over 12,386,000 votes were counted, representing 59.97 percent of the eligible electorate, with a little more than 50,000 votes, or 0.41 percent, declared invalid.
Amoroso blamed "massive cyberattacks" against the election technological infrastructure and the country's main telecommunications companies for the delayed transmission of results and the delayed disclosure process.
Despite the burning of electoral offices, voting centers, and what he described as "terrorist attacks," Amoroso said the National Electoral Council managed to transmit the majority of the results.
He expressed gratitude to the Armed Forces, international observers, and officials, who he said had made the July 28 presidential elections possible. â–

SAO PAULO, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Six people drowned and another six were injured when a passenger boat capsized off the coast of Brazil as it was ferrying revelers to a party, the Fire Department reported Monday.
The accident occurred Sunday night in the Bay of All Saints, near the metropolitan region of Salvador, capital of central Bahia state.
A spokesperson for the Fire Department reported that two people remained missing, according to the GloboNews network.
Among the fatal victims are a 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old teenager.
According to a Navy spokesperson, authorities opened an investigation to determine if a fight on board caused the vessel to turn over as it was taking people to a party two kilometers away, and whether the vessel was authorized for commercial use to transport passengers.
The exact number of passengers on board at the time of the shipwreck is unknown. â–

CARACAS, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Attorney General's Office on Monday sought an arrest warrant against former Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia for various charges, including conspiracy, usurpation of authority, and sabotage.
The office posted on its Instagram account a letter addressed to the judge presiding over cases related to terrorism, detailing a series of alleged offenses, including document forgery and incitement to defy the law.
Gonzalez ignored three summonses to appear before prosecutors investigating him.
After losing the July 28 presidential elections, Gonzalez and another opposition presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado refused to recognize President Nicolas Maduro's win and claimed the result was fraught with irregularities. â–

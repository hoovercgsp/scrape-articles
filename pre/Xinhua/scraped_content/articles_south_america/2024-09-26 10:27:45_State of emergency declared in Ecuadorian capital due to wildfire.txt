QUITO, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency was declared on Wednesday in Ecuador's capital Quito as wildfires continue to devastate parts of the city, said Mayor Pabel Munoz.
The decision was made by Quito's Emergency Operations Committee after assessing damage from a massive fire in the Guapulo area in the eastern part of the city.
The fire, which began on Tuesday, has been the most destructive one the city has faced in recent years, scorching large swathes of vegetation, destroying six homes in central-northern Quito, and engulfing the city in thick smoke.
"This declaration may help us secure at least half a million dollars from international cooperation agencies, which will be critical for the reconstruction and recovery of damaged ecosystems," Munoz said.
Emergency response efforts are underway as authorities work to contain the remaining fire hotspots. â–

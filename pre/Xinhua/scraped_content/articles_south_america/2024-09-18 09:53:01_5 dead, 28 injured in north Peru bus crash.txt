LIMA, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed and 28 others injured on Tuesday after two buses collided in north Peru's La Libertad region, said the National Police of Peru (PNP).
The accident occurred on a road in the Chicama District, Ascope Province, involving a passenger bus traveling between the Gran Chimu and Trujillo provinces, and another vehicle transporting workers from an agro-industrial company.
"We have a report of 28 wounded," PNP Commander Carlos Odria told a local media outlet. "Personnel from two mobile units are at the scene, providing support and assistance to the wounded."
The PNP has not ruled out speeding as a possible cause and is continuing to investigate the incident. â–

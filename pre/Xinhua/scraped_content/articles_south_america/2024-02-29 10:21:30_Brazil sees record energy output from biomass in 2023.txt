RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- In 2023, a record 3,218 average megawatts (MW) were generated from biomass in Brazil, constituting 4.6 percent of the year's total energy consumption, the Ministry of Mines and Energy said Tuesday.
"We are working on several fronts to continue being a benchmark for clean energy around the world. In 2023, 93.6 percent of our electricity was generated from renewable sources, which reinforces Brazil's position as a world leader in energy transition," said Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira.
Brazil's previous record was set in 2020, when average energy output from biomass plants totaled 3,140 MW. In 2023 there was an increase in installed biomass capacity of 223 MW and, for 2024, output is expected to increase by 1,155 MW, for a new record.
Last year, the contribution of biomass to power generation ranged between 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent monthly.
There are 637 projects powered by biomass throughout Brazil, among which 422 use sugarcane bagasse, with a total capacity of 12,410 MW. Forestry waste fuels some 76 power plants, generating 820 MW. Biogas provides 201 MW.
Black liquor, generated by the pulp and paper industry, fuels just 22 projects, though they are capable of generating 3,334 MW, making it the second largest energy source of biomass subsources.
In 2023, Brazil expanded electricity output by a record 10,300 MW, with 291 plants going into operation.
Wind farms took the lead, with 140 new ones generating 4,919 megawatts, or 47.65 percent of the growth in output, followed by 104 new photovoltaic solar plants, which generated 4,070.9 MW.
In addition, other plants that came into operation last year include 33 thermoelectric plants, 11 small hydroelectric stations and three hydroelectric plants. â–

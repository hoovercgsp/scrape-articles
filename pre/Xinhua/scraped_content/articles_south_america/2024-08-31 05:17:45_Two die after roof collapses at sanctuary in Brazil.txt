RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and several others injured after the roof of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Conception collapsed in Recife, the capital of Brazil's northeastern state of Pernambuco, during the distribution of food baskets to the underprivileged, local authorities reported on Friday.
The Recife City Council confirmed that at least two people died, while the exact number of injured and their conditions remain unknown.
The collapse took place during a food distribution event organized by the archdiocese inside the sanctuary.
"I've just been informed of the roof collapse at the Morro de Conception Sanctuary in Recife ... our security teams have already been mobilized to provide immediate rescue and assistance to the victims," said Pernambuco Governor Raquel Lyra in a statement.
The sanctuary, a site for masses and religious ceremonies, is a regular destination for worshippers who come to pray and fulfill religious vows.
The building features glass walls, offering views from both inside and outside the church. â–

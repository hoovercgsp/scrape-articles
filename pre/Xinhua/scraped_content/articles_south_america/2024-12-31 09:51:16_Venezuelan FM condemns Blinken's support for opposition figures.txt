CARACAS, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on Monday criticized U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken of supporting "the worst opposition" in South America.
The foreign minister made the remarks on social media after Blinken voiced U.S. support for two Venezuelan opposition figures.
Gil said that Washington has failed many times to "fight against" Venezuela during the past four years and this time it will be "no different".
He said that the Venezuelan people and government will overcome the obstacles made by the United States and build a sovereign and independent country.
According to local media, Blinken pledged to "commit to a peaceful restoration of democracy in Venezuela" in a telephone with Venezuelan opposition figures on Monday. â–

BRASILIA, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil manager Dorival Junior has admitted that his team must beat Peru on Tuesday to provide peace of mind in its quest to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.
Brazil are currently fourth in the 10-team South American zone standings with 13 points from nine games, six points behind leaders Argentina. Peru, meanwhile, are ninth, seven points further back.
"We are aware that our situation is not comfortable," Dorival said ahead of the clash at Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brasilia.
"We've had a difficult period but we have to be aware that we are in a transition process and a recovery will help to bring stability."
Dorival admitted the five-time world champions had failed to reach their usual lofty standards in recent months. But he hoped that support from fans in Brasilia would serve to re-inject confidence in his players.
"We are trying to regain the support [of our fans], even though we know that we are not doing so well," the 62-year-old said. "The national team needs its fans to play well and the fans need to regain confidence in the national team."
Dorival vowed to continue putting faith in young players such as teenager forwards Endrick and Estevao.
"We have promising players and sometimes our immediate expectations are unrealistic," Dorival said. "It's not easy for them to take the step up and adapt to international football. When they do that I'm sure you'll see a big improvement." â–

BRASILIA, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's government on Tuesday issued a decree to regulate the use of force by law enforcement, prescribing firearms as the "last resort" only used by trained professionals.
The decree, signed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, establishes clear guidelines for the use of firearms and less-lethal weapons, along with mandatory training for police officers and public security professionals nationwide.
It also regulates the use of force and security tools with less offensive potential in a bid to promote efficiency, transparency, recognition of public security professionals, and respect for human rights.
A National Committee to Monitor the Use of Force will be created to monitor and evaluate the implementation of these policies amid concerns over police violence, particularly in Sao Paulo. â–

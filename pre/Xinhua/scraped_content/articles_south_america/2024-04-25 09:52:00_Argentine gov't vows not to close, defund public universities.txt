BUENOS AIRES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's government on Wednesday promised not to close or defund public universities following massive marches across the country demanding continued funding of higher education.
"It will never be on our agenda to close a public university," presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a press conference at government headquarters in the capital city of Buenos Aires.
However, Adorni stressed that authorities plan to audit the spending at such institutions.
"Let us clarify a thousand times that we are going to defend the public universities like no one else," Adorni said, "only quality public education is sustainable on the path we are traveling, with the balance of public accounts and the audits we deem appropriate."
Thousands of students, accompanied by teachers, principals, deans, non-teaching staff, unions, and varied social and political organizations, took to the streets of Buenos Aires and other major cities on Tuesday.
In Buenos Aires, students marched to Plaza de Mayo, the government headquarters, where President of the Argentine University Federation Piera Fernandez de Piccoli read a document signed by all the national universities.
"The Argentine public universities are going through a critical period as a consequence of the policy implemented by the national government. We call on citizens to support open public universities," said Fernandez de Piccoli. "They are one of the engines of democracy, production, and social ties." â–

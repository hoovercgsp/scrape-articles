SANTIAGO, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile's financial market has forecast 2.2 percent economic growth for 2025 followed by 2.1 percent growth in 2026, the Central Bank of Chile said Tuesday.
Next year's growth forecast from financial analysts falls below the government's projection of 2.7 percent expansion in gross domestic product (GDP), but falls within the parameters of the central bank's estimated growth between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent.
In February's Economic Expectations Survey, the analysts consulted by the bank also offered their growth forecast for 2027, estimating a 2.1 percent expansion in GDP.
Queried about inflation, analysts said they expect a 4.1 percent rate for this year, with slight variations in February and March.
Analysts expect the consumer price index to reach 3 percent in 2026, in line with the target range established by the Andean country's central bank for a healthy economy.
Regarding the monetary policy rate, a tool used to curb inflation by adjusting interest rates, the figure is expected to remain at 5 percent over the next few months before dropping to 4.75 percent at the end of the year, depending on the inflationary outlook.
Chile ended 2024 with a surprising uptick in economic activity in December of 6.6 percent year on year, leading to 2.5 percent growth for the whole year, according to preliminary figures from the central bank. â–

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday authorized the social media platform X to resume operations in the country after being banned for over a month due to non-compliance with court rulings.
Judge Alexandre de Moraes lifted the ban after X paid approximately 28.6 million reals (around 5.17 million U.S. dollars) in fines to the Brazilian government, local media reported.
"I hereby declare the suspension lifted and authorize the immediate resumption of X Brasil Internet Ltd.'s activities within the national territory. I also order the National Telecommunications Agency to implement this decision and report back to this Supreme Court within 24 hours," Moraes ruled.
X was banned on Aug. 30 for refusing to appoint a legal representative in Brazil and for not paying fines for disregarding a court order.
The platform has since appointed a legal representative and complied with a separate court order to block the accounts of individuals being investigated for inciting a coup in Brazil. â–

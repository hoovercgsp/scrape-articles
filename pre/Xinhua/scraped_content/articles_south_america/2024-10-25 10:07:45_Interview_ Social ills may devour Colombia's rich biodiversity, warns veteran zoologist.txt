CALI, Colombia, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- An expert has warned that Colombia risks losing its rich biodiversity due to domestic challenges and because "we are not caring for our planet" as we should.
Maria Clara Dominguez, CEO of the Cali Zoological Foundation, said Colombia has lost 70 percent of its biodiversity over the last half-century. She noted that Colombia faces significant social challenges, particularly from rebel groups operating in its biodiverse green areas.
Rebel activities, including illegal mining, logging, and cocaine cultivation, have harmed the environment and made the country more vulnerable to global warming.
Furthermore, although national parks and conserved areas cover around 20 percent of Colombia's land, "it doesn't mean that these territories are safe," Dominguez said.
Due to poverty, local residents in such areas often engage in illegal logging and clear land for cattle and new crops to make a living, leading to deforestation.
Cali, a city southwest of Colombia's capital Bogota, was selected to host the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP16) from Oct. 21 to Nov. 1.
To restore biodiversity, resources and technology from the international community and cooperation with local communities are essential, Dominguez noted.
Colombians understand the reality of the country better than foreigners, she said. "If you don't join hands with the people living around ... you can do nothing." â–

LA PAZ, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government announced a new plan on Tuesday to ensure that necessities reach consumers at fair prices. The plan aims to fight speculation in the markets and curb smuggling to neighboring countries.
Deputy Minister of Defense of User and Consumer Rights Jorge Silva said the plan includes strict controls from production to the final points of sale to ensure the orderly progress of the entire distribution process of essential products.
This measure aims to curb the illegal exportation of necessities, such as rice and sugar, to markets in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, where the prices of these products could double or even quintuple.
Silva said that smuggling is exacerbating inflation in Bolivia. In August, the Consumer Price Index rose by 1.58 percent, reaching 116.25 percent, the year's highest figure.
The current state of inflation in Bolivia has exceeded official expectations for 2024, with an accumulated rate of 4.61 percent through August. It has already surpassed the projected 3.6 percent for the entire year, according to the National Institute of Statistics. â–

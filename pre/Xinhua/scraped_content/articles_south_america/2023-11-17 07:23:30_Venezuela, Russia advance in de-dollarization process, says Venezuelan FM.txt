CARACAS, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Russia are moving forward in their de-dollarization process to protect and boost their financial, commercial and economic relations, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said on Thursday.
Gil held a meeting in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, where they agreed to "reinforce" financial communication between the central banks of the two countries, he said on social media.
The official noted that the Russian Mir payment system was already 100 percent operational throughout Venezuela.
Gil also said in a statement, published by the official Agencia Venezolana de Noticias, that "Venezuela is willing to join the BRICS group as soon as possible."
For his part, Lavrov said that Russia will support "the desire of our friends to cooperate and actively participate in this association."
Gil said the West seeks to undermine the sovereignty of Russia and Venezuela, but it will not succeed, since Moscow and Caracas "will protect their bilateral relations from all kinds of unilateral restrictive measures."
He added that Venezuela and Russia have reached "important agreements" to counteract the West's sanctions policy, according to Agencia Venezolana de Noticias. â–

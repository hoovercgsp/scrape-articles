RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a road accident on Saturday in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais has risen to 41, the police said on Sunday.
The accident, which occurred early Saturday morning in the municipality of Teofilo Otoni, has also left at least a dozen injured who were sent to a local hospital, making it the worst on a Brazilian federal highway since 2008.
Initial investigations revealed that a large granite block fell from a van onto the road, where it was struck head-on by an oncoming bus. The impact caused the bus to catch fire and overturn, while a passenger car traveling behind the van collided with the rear of the bus.
According to police reports, the truck's driver has fled and is being pursued. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday swore in Gerardo Werthein as his new minister of foreign affairs, the president's office said in a statement.
Werthein, a 68-year-old veterinarian and businessman, has served as Argentina's ambassador to the United States since May.
His predecessor, Diana Mondino, was removed from office by Milei on Oct. 30.
Mondino's departure marks the fourth departure from Milei's cabinet since he took office in December last year. â–

SANTIAGO, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- A 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck northern Chile on Monday, with no immediate reports of casualties or damage, authorities said.
The quake occurred at 1:27 p.m. local time (1627 GMT) and its epicenter was located at 12 km southwest of Iquique, about 1,750 km north of the capital, Santiago. With its focus at a depth of 39 km, the temblor was felt in nearby towns, said the University of Chile's National Seismological Center.
The Chilean Navy's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service ruled out any tsunami threat on the Chilean coast.
Chile, situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, is one of the world's most seismically active countries. â–

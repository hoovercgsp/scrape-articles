CARACAS, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro declared "fascism has failed in Venezuela" in a meeting Monday with the national leadership of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and its allies in the Great Patriotic Pole coalition.
"We will not allow fascism to assault power in Venezuela," Maduro said, calling on supporters "to consolidate the victory against hatred, against lies, against manipulation."
Assessing Venezuela's political landscape after the July 28 presidential elections, Maduro said the coalition and its supporters were "defeating a coup d'etat."
He described post-election attempts to destabilize the country through online disinformation campaigns as a "cyber coup d'etat," warning that "woe betide anyone who falls for the narrative that attempts to justify a coup d'etat and the establishment of a violent regime."
"Fascism has failed in Venezuela, we have defeated it," he said.
Immediately following the presidential elections, violence broke out in parts of the capital Caracas and other cities, which the government said was instigated by opposition groups. â–

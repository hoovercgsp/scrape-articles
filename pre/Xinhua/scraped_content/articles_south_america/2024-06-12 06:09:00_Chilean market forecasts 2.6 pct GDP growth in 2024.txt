SANTIAGO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chilean market analysts have forecast an economic growth of 2.6 percent for the country in 2024, slightly less than the government's projection of 2.7 percent, Chile's Central Bank said Tuesday.
Economists consulted for the bank's June Economic Expectations Survey said they expect Chile's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 2.2 percent in 2025.
They projected a variation in inflation of 0.2 percent for the month and of 3.2 percent over 11 months.
The experts predicted that by the end of 2024, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will reach 3.9 percent, above the bank's target range of 3 percent.
In May, inflation in Chile registered 0.3 percent, accumulating 2.4 percent so far this year, and a variation of 4.1 percent year on year, according to figures from the National Statistics Institute.
The interest rate is expected to maintain its downward trend, remaining at 5 percent over the next five months and declining to 4.75 percent at the end of 2024. â–

CARACAS, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government on Tuesday expressed its "strong" rejection of recent statements by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken regarding the South American country's internal affairs.
Blinken is "stuck in a false and monotonous narrative against the will of the Venezuelan people" and "insists on his complicity with violent far-right extremists," Venezuela's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.
The U.S. official on Monday said it was necessary that "the votes of Venezuelans be truly respected," referring to the results of Venezuela's July 28 presidential elections.
In response, the ministry said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's reelection to another term was "a demonstration of the popular support enjoyed by the Bolivarian Revolution."
The ministry also criticized the "neocolonial" conduct of the U.S. government for serving as "the basis of support for local fascist groups" that attempt to undermine Venezuelan institutions.
Venezuela urged the U.S. government to "deal with the serious problems it faces, and cease once and for all its constant interference in the affairs of Venezuelans." â–

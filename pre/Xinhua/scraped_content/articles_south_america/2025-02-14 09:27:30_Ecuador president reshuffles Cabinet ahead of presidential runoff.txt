QUITO, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa reshuffled his Cabinet on Thursday, following Sunday's presidential election that left him facing a runoff vote.
Luis Jaramillo Granja will be minister of economy and finance; Carlos Alberto Zaldumbide will be minister of production, foreign trade, investment and fisheries; Harold Burbano will replace Zaida Rovira as minister of economic and social inclusion.
Rovira was named the new governor of the southwest coastal province of Guayas, the country's most populated and crime-ridden.
Sunday's presidential election was not conclusive.
Noboa of the National Democratic Action movement led with 44.5 percent, narrowly surpassing Luisa Gonzalez, candidate of the Citizen Revolution movement, who garnered 43.99 percent, according to figures of the National Electoral Council. A runoff between the two leading candidates is scheduled for April 13. â–

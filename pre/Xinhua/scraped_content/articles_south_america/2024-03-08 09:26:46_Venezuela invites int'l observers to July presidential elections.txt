CARACAS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has invited various international organizations to participate as observers in the upcoming presidential elections on July 28, CNE president Elvis Amoroso said Thursday.
Among those organizations are the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the BRICS, the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations, and a UN Panel of Electoral Experts, the official told reporters.
The Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the African Union, the European Union and the Carter Center may also participate in the electoral process as observers, he said.
The CNE's invitation to these organizations will be effective as long as they "comply with the requirements and constitutional regulations," he added.
The invitations comply with proposals contained in accords reached with Venezuelan opposition political parties and social sectors, such as the Barbados Agreement (October 2023) and the Great Caracas Agreement (February 2024), he noted.
The CNE previously published an electoral calendar that establishes, among other things, deadlines for registering voters, nominating candidates and campaign periods. â–

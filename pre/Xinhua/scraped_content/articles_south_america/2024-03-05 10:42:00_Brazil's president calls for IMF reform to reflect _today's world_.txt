BRASILIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Monday called for reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make it "more representative of today's world."
During his meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Lula talked about the necessity of reforming the multilateral lending agency so as to make it more "capable of helping countries that need to resort to the IMF under better conditions."
The meeting also addressed the development of social inclusion and the global fight against poverty, Lula said on X, formerly Twitter.
Lula had earlier expressed his support for reforming international financial organizations, including the World Bank, and refinancing the debt of the poorest countries.
The meeting marked the end of Georgieva's trip to Brazil, during which she participated in a meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of 20 held last week in the city of Sao Paulo. â–

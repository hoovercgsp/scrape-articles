CARACAS, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department considers Venezuela's oil and energy reserves a "geostrategic objective," Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Thursday.
Speaking at a debate panel during the Russian Energy Week 2024, an international forum being held in Moscow, Rodriguez said Venezuela's oil industry has already been the victim of U.S. "piracy."
Rodriguez added that countries subject to U.S. sanctions are fighting "for existence as a nation" and are contributing to "international economic balance."
By resisting, she said, these nations play a key role in global development.
The emergence of alternatives such as the BRICS bloc is enabling sanctioned countries to experience a "geopolitical reconfiguration," she added. â–

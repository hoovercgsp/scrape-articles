LA PAZ, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 civilian and military suspects are under investigation for their alleged role in the failed coup attempt against Bolivian President Luis Arce on June 26, the Prosecutor's Office said Tuesday.
"We must stress that in general it is quite a complex case," Prosecutor Franklin Alborta told reporters, adding: "Preliminarily, we are reporting that more than 30 people are already formally under investigation."
One of the suspects most lately arrested on Monday was Vladimir Lupa Salamanca, the commander of F10, an elite group of the armed forces. He is scheduled to give testimony to prosecutors in La Paz.
Among the main defendants are former army commander and coup leader General Juan Jose Zuniga, former navy commander Juan Arnez, and former air force commander Marcelo Zegarra. â–

BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Friday launched its vaccination campaign against dengue fever in the Federal District, targeting 521 municipalities nationwide identified as priorities, said the country's health ministry.
Brazil becomes the first country in the world to incorporate dengue immunization into the public health network. With the receipt of 6.5 million available doses in 2024, the health ministry will ensure the vaccination for the entire target public, it said.
The priority municipalities will receive the first doses of the vaccine for children aged 10 to 11 until the end of March, said Ethel Maciel, the Secretary of Health Surveillance and Environment.
Warning signs among infected individuals include persistent vomiting and abdominal pain. Authorities strongly advise seeking immediate medical attention in such cases, with hydration being emphasized as the fundamental treatment. â–

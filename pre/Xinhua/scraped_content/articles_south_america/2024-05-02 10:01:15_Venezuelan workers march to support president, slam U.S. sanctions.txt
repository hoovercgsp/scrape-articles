CARACAS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan workers from across the country rallied in the capital Caracas on Wednesday to show their support for President Nicolas Maduro, condemning the sanctions imposed by the United States.
Among those marching in the May Day parade was Edgar Villanueva, a worker from central Cojedes state, who told state-run Venezolana de Television he was expressing his repudiation of the sanctions that "are harming the working class" and their purchasing power.
Carlos Moreno, from the eastern state of Delta Amacuro, said workers continue to "support our president, who has remained firm through all the difficulties that our country has gone through."
Earlier in the day, Maduro congratulated workers on International Workers' Day, in a post on social media. â–

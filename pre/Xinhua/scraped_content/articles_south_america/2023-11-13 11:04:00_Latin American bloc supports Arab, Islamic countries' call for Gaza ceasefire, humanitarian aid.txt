CARACAS, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Latin American and Caribbean organization announced its support Sunday for Arab and Islamic countries' call for Gaza ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and stopping arms from entering Israel.
The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) "joins the denunciation and condemnation" of Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip, which is "committing atrocities and systematic violations of human rights," the regional bloc said in a statement.
At the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit hosted by Saudi Arabia on Saturday, leaders from the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation called for an immediate ceasefire, the entry of humanitarian aid, the halting of arms exports to Israel, and the International Criminal Court's investigation into Israel's violations in Gaza.
ALBA-TCP member states voiced support for "any initiative to put an end to the massacre in Gaza," in addition to respecting international humanitarian law and complying with the UN resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Aimed at regional integration in political, economic, and social aspects, ALBA-TCP has 10 full members, which are Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, Nicaragua, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Venezuela.
The Israel-Hamas conflict has claimed more than 11,180 lives on the Palestinian side and around 1,200 on the Israeli side since the conflict started on Oct. 7. â–

LIMA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were killed and 14 others were injured when a passenger bus plunged into a ravine about 50 meters deep in southern Peru on Tuesday, local authorities said.
The bus crashed around 6:30 a.m. local time on the Libertadores highway as it was traveling from Lima to the city of Ayacucho, said the Regional Health Directorate's Center for Prevention and Control of Emergencies and Disasters in the southern department of Ayacucho.

Some 32 passengers and two drivers were aboard the vehicle when the accident occurred, news outlet Radio Programas del Peru reported, quoting the company's lawyer. â–

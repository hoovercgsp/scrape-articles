LIMA, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Consumer Price Index (CPI) at the national level saw a 0.30 percent increase in December, closing the January-December 2023 period with an inflation rate of 3.41 percent, the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) reported Monday.
The report said that the CPI increase registered in December at the national level was due to increases above the national average in the transport divisions by 1.10 percent, food and non-alcoholic beverages by 0.38 percent, and tobacco by 0.36 percent.
The increase in the transportation sector was mainly due to the higher demand for tickets for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, causing price increases in air passenger transportation by 6.1 percent, mainly in domestic air and road transportation.
Meanwhile, the CPI index for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased due to higher prices of meat products, mineral waters and soft drinks, as well as bread and cereals.
In December, consumer prices increased in 18 cities. Meanwhile, at least eight cities showed price decreases, with variations below between 0.56 and 0.12 percent. â–

SANTIAGO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Gabriel Boric on Thursday said the latest wildfire in the fire-ravaged central Valparaiso region burnt 20 homes on Wednesday night, but fortunately it claimed no lives.
"Thanks to the rapid deployment of firefighters, along with the National Forestry Corporation (Conaf), all the fires that we saw yesterday in the region of Valparaiso ... have been contained," the president told local media.
While at least 20 homes were affected, he said, there were no injuries or fatalities in the fires that burnt about 2.5 hectares of land at Cerro Cordillera in Valparaiso, located one hour from the capital Santiago.
"At this moment, work is being carried out with all the required urgency ... the government has all the necessary resources and energy focused on supporting all those in need," the president said.
Forest fires began to plague the Valparaiso region more than a month ago, claiming 134 lives to date and destroying 6,019 homes. â–

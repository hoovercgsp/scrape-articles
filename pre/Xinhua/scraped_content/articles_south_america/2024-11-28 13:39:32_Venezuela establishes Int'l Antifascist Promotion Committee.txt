CARACAS, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government established on Wednesday the International Antifascist Promotion Committee to unite global governments in defense of antifascist, anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist values.
At the inauguration ceremony of the committee, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said the initiative proposed by President Nicolas Maduro called for "mobilizing all the peoples of the world" around these values and guiding the international community towards the goal of "definitively defeating fascism."
In the face of the growing threat of fascism in the West, Gil said it is imperative to promote anti-fascist and anti-colonialist causes.
Some 1,000 delegates from 75 countries participated in the ceremony. â–

LIMA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen said on Saturday that the raid carried out by the public prosecutor's office and the police on the home of President Dina Boluarte on Friday night was "disproportionate."
"What has happened constitutes an intolerable violation of the dignity of the president of the republic and the nation she represents," he told the local radio station Radio Programas del Peru.
The raid was carried out as part of an investigation into the alleged crime of "illicit enrichment" following a media report claiming the president possessed several luxury watches that she failed to declare.
The search at the president's home was approved by the supreme judge following the request of National Prosecutor Juan Carlos Villena, who led the case.
Boluarte said earlier that she would go to the prosecutor's office to disclose the "truth" about her luxury watches, but then requested a rescheduling of the subpoena, citing her "busy schedule."
Villena rejected the request and described it as "an indicator of defiance" to "delay the outcome of the investigation." â–

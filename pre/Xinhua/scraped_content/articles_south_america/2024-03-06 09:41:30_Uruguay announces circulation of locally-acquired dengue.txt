MONTEVIDEO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay announced the circulation of locally-acquired cases of dengue after two indigenous cases had been confirmed, the Public Health Ministry said here Tuesday.
"In recent days we have had the news that two cases of dengue appeared that are not travel related. What we have verified is that in Uruguay we already have viral circulation of dengue," Health Minister Karina Rando said at a press conference.
The first two cases were registered in Montevideo. A third case of autochthonous dengue was reported in the department of Florida after the announcement of viral circulation, the daily El Observador reported.
Uruguay's health authorities have so far confirmed 36 cases of dengue in total, including 33 imported cases.
Dengue cases have been reported in Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. Brazilian Health Ministry has registered over 1.2 million suspected cases of dengue fever with 299 deaths.
Dengue "has become an important public health problem in the Americas," Rando said, noting "cases are rising in Uruguay."
The health ministry has called on the Uruguayan public to maximize prevention and control measures to minimize exposure to the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito which carries the virus of dengue. â–

QUITO, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Hooded and armed suspects broke into an Ecuadorian television studio Tuesday and terrorized the staff while they were on the air, sending shock waves through the country.
Viewers watched as the events unfolded live, witnessing the suspects point their weapons at the employees of local "TC Television" station in the southwest coastal city of Guayaquil.
Station employees remained lying on the floor, visibly shaken by what was happening. Amid the chaos, a series of gunshots rang out as employees pleaded for the shooting to stop.
After a burst of gunfire, the broadcast abruptly went off the air.
There were no immediate reports of victims or official statements from the government.
The National Police posted to social media platform X that "Given the entry of criminals into the facilities of a media outlet in Guayaquil, our specialized units are being deployed at the scene to address this emergency."
The unprecedented event followed months of escalating violence that led President Daniel Noboa on Monday to declare a 60-day state of emergency with a nighttime curfew to stem the unrest, including at prisons.
As part of the measure, the military has been mobilized to bolster policing. â–

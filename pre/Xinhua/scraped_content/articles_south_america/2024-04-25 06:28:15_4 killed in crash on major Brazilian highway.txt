SAO PAULO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed after two cargo trucks and a car crashed Wednesday on one of Brazil's main highways, the Federal Highway Police said.
The accident occurred on one of the main overground trade routes in South America, the Regis Bittencourt Highway, in Itapecerica da Serra in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo.
Among the fatal victims were two women and two men, according to a Fire Department report cited by local press.
One of the vehicles caught fire due to the collision.

LIMA, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Peruvian National Police died after their boat capsized Sunday afternoon on a rescue mission in the Majes River in the southern Arequipa region, Peru's interior ministry said Monday.
Seven officers were reportedly on the boat, searching for one of three miners who had disappeared along the river days ago. The other five were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries.
The bodies of Percy Coronel Condori and Jorge Marquez Martinez were found hours after the boat capsized, according to local media.
Citing police sources, news broadcaster Radio Programas del Peru said the capsize was likely caused by the river's "strong current," in the Aplao district in the Castilla province in Arequipa.
"We don't know whether or not the officers had the necessary safety equipment for this type of work," the sources said.
Arequipa has seen heavy rains in recent days that caused the river's strong flow, according to Latina Television.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, the interior ministry expressed its "heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones" of the two officers, who "sacrificed their lives in the line of duty."
Peruvian daily La Republica said the incident involving the three miners occurred on Feb. 20 as they tried to cross the river and were swept away by the current.
After several days of scouring the river, police officers found the bodies of two missing miners and continued searching for the third. â–

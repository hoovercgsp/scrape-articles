BUENOS AIRES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will stop expanding its monetary base to reduce inflation in the country, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo said on Saturday.
"From now on the amount of money remains the same or is reduced," the minister said on X, formerly Twitter.
Argentina's consumer price index rose 4.6 percent in June, ending a five-month trend of cooling inflation.
Caputo added that the exchange rate will not undergo modifications. "That is to say, the amount of pesos will not grow anymore, it will only shrink, since the country currently has a fiscal surplus," he said. â–

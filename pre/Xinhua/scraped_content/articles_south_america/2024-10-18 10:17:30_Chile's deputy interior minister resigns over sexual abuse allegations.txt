SANTIAGO, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile Interior Ministry Undersecretary Manuel Monsalve resigned Thursday over allegations of sexual abuse.
"I want to inform that I have submitted my resignation to the president. I have done so because a complaint has been filed against me," Monsalve said in a statement.
He said he had "absolute conviction" of having done nothing wrong, "therefore, within the framework of the investigation I will prove my innocence."
According to local media, a regional prosecutor revealed there was a judicial process against Monsalve due to an accusation of sexual abuse. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- An Argentine court Wednesday suspended the labor clause included in President Javier Milei's Decree of Necessity and Urgency, an executive order he signed last month to make changes to laws regarding layoffs and the right to strike, among others.
Judges from the National Chamber of Labor Appeals issued the ruling as a "precautionary measure" in response to a request from the General Confederation of Labor, the country's main labor union.
According to the court's ruling, adopted by a 2-1 vote, several labor norms Milei intends to modify through executive order, "without giving intervention to legislators, are repressive or sanctioning in nature," and it was not clear how the order would benefit Milei's objective of "creating real jobs."
Milei announced the decree in a message broadcast over the national radio and television network, saying the reforms would "unblock an oppressive legal and institutional framework."
The decree's 366 articles aim to lay "the foundations for the reconstruction of the Argentine economy," according to its title. â–

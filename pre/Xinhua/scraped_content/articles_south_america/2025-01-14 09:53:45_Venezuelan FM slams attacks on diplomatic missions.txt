CARACAS, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on Monday denounced attacks on several of the country's diplomatic missions, describing them as "a coordinated action" by the country's political opponents.
"Several of our consular offices have been attacked by extremists who do the same damage to our diplomatic offices that they want to do to our beloved Bolivarian Homeland," Gil said on Telegram.
Gil called on the authorities in the five countries where the attacks occurred -- Portugal, Germany, Colombia, Spain and Costa Rica -- to "speed up the investigations to find those responsible." â–

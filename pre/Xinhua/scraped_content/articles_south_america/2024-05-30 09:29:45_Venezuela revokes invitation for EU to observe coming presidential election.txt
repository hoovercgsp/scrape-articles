CARACAS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) on Tuesday revoked an invitation to an EU mission to observe the South American country's July 28 presidential elections.
The CNE said on Wednesday that the EU "aims to interfere" in the body's decisions.
Describing the EU as "insolent," CNE President Elvis Amoroso said that the considerations issued by the council "are the exclusive responsibility of Venezuelans."
The EU said it "deeply regrets" the unilateral decision by the electoral body, and noted that its role as an observer was part of the Barbados Agreement.
The agreement, signed by the Venezuelan authorities and the opposition in October 2023, aims to ease dialogue between the two sides as well as promote negotiations aiming at free and fair elections in the country.
In response, Amoroso said that the elections will have "an extensive program of oversight and accompaniment from dozens of prestigious international organizations, as well as more than 250 personalities." â–

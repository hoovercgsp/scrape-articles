QUITO, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said on Wednesday that he will announce "urgent steps" on Thursday to end power outages due to severe drought in the country.
"We have to face this crisis, and we are going to get out of this crisis ... We must make the fastest, most urgent decision that benefits the people as quickly as possible," Noboa said during an inspection of a roadway project in the western province of Manabi.
He said the past few months have been "intense" for the government, as the energy crisis stemming from the worst drought in six decades has affected the reservoirs of hydroelectric plants.
Ecuador relies heavily on hydroelectric power to meet its energy needs. The power cuts, with some lasting up to 10 hours per day, have been in effect since Sept. 23. â–

LA PAZ, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Luis Arce on Tuesday pledged support for Mexico's lawsuit against Ecuador at the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ), over its raid of the Mexican embassy in Quito.
"We will accompany you in international and judicial instances in this lawsuit that we consider absolutely fair to set a definitive precedent and ensure that this does not happen again," Arce said during a virtual summit of the heads of state of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.
Mexico filed an official complaint at the ICJ, in which it requested Ecuador be suspended from the United Nations until it apologizes for raiding the embassy and guarantees it will not again violate international law and sovereignty.
On April 5, Ecuadorian police raided the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest Jorge Glas, former Ecuadorian vice president, who had been holed up there since December. Mexico subsequently suspended diplomatic relations with Ecuador. â–

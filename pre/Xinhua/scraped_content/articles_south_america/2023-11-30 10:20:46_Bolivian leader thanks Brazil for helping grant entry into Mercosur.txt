LA PAZ, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Luis Arce on Wednesday thanked his Brazilian counterpart for his efforts to get Brazil's Senate to approve Bolivia's full membership in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
Bolivia thanks the efforts of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and the Brazilian people in approving the draft decree for the full accession of Bolivia to Mercosur, said the Bolivian president.
The Chamber of Deputies in Brazil endorsed the measure in October, and a working group is set to be formed to devise a schedule for Bolivia's adherence to Mercosur regulations.
Mercosur members of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay have already approved Bolivia's entry. â–

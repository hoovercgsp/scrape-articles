SAO PAULO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Three teenagers were killed and another missing due to a waterspout while they were cooling off in a waterfall in Paranavai city in the southern Brazilian state of Parana, the local fire department said Monday.
In total, eight people were injured as a result of the sudden increase in the volume of water in the waterfall used by residents and tourists for recreation at an event before dusk on Sunday.
Rescue teams continued the search on Monday for the missing person, a 43-year-old woman.
The rainfall measurement system of Parana reported 53 mm of rain at the head of the waterfall, which caused the waterspout that detached trees and rocks and dragged them against people who were mitigating the heat, according to the news network GloboNews. â–

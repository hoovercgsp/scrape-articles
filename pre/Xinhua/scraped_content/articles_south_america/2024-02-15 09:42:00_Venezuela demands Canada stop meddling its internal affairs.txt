CARACAS, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada must stop interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs, Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil said Wednesday, in response to Canada's expression of concern over the detention of an NGO leader in the South American country.
"The Government of Canada, trapped in its superiority complex, believing itself to be an empire and from its moral misery, insists on attacking Venezuela. Get your noses out of our country!" Gil said on X, formerly Twitter.
Venezuelan authorities on Sunday announced Rocio San Miguel, president of the NGO Control Ciudadano, had been arrested for her alleged links to such crimes as treason, conspiracy, terrorism and criminal association.
The NGO says it aims to "promote and exercise citizen oversight on matters of security, defense and the National Armed Forces."
Expressing the Canadian government's concern over the arrest, the Canadian embassy in Venezuela said: "We call for the full implementation of the Barbados Agreement," referring to the talks between the Venezuelan government and opposition groups in October 2023.
Canada, said Gil, not only has "a shameful record" of human rights violations in its own territory, but also plays into "the hands of terrorists and destabilizers" looking to undermine the Venezuelan government. â–

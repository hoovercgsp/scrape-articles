LIMA, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Congress on Thursday approved President Dina Boluarte's request to allow U.S. military personnel to enter the country to assist with security for the upcoming APEC leaders' summit.
Congress voted 63-23, with seven abstentions, to allow 600 armed U.S. military personnel to enter Peru from Nov. 4 to 24 to provide administrative, logistical and security support to U.S. President Joe Biden during the 2024 APEC meetings.
The meetings are scheduled for Nov. 10-16 in the Peruvian cities of Lima, Pisco, and Chiclayo.
U.S. forces will enter Peru with helicopters, tankers, weapons and other equipment. The cost will be covered by the U.S. Department of Defense, and thus will not incur additional expenses for Peru, said the Peruvian government.
The authorization in no way affects Peru's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor does it involve the installation of foreign military bases, said Adriana Tudela, president of the congressional National Defense Commission. â–

LA PAZ, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed after their car crashed into a wall and burst into flames near a lithium carbonate plant in Uyuni Salt Flats, in the Bolivian department of Potosi, said local authorities on Thursday.
"The vehicle was likely traveling at excessive speed" when the driver lost control, collided with the wall, and came to a stop approximately 70 meters from the point of impact, Juan Carlos Oblitas, the deputy commander of Potosi Police, briefed reporters on the accident that occurred early Wednesday.
The bodies of the four fatal victims -- two men and two women -- all Bolivian nationals, were taken to the local morgue, said the police. â–

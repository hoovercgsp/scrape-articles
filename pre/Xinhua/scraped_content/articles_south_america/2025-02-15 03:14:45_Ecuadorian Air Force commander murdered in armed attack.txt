QUITO, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant Colonel Porfirio Javier Cedeno, commander of the Special Operations Group of the Ecuadorian Air Force (FAE), was murdered Friday in an armed attack in the southwestern coastal city of Guayaquil, local media reported.
Ecuadorian media said that the attack occurred after 7:30 a.m. local time when Cedeno was driving toward the city of Manta, in the western province of Manabi, to attend a military ceremony.
Through social platform X, the Armed Forces and the Ecuadorian Army expressed their deep regret for the death of Cedeno, who had a military career of more than 20 years.
The murder adds to the wave of attacks on politicians, mayors, prosecutors and prison officials by organized crime, to which the government attributes the escalation of violence plaguing Ecuador.
Since Jan. 9, 2024, the South American country has been waging an "internal armed conflict" declared by President Daniel Noboa against 22 transnational organized crime groups. â–

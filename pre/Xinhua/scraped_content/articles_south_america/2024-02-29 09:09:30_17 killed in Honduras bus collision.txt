TEGUCIGALPA, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were killed and a dozen injured when two buses collided Wednesday in the municipality of San Juan de Opoa, in western Honduras' department of Copan, local authorities said.
"Soldiers and firefighters are working hard to attend to this emergency and provide all possible help to those affected," the armed forces said on X, formerly Twitter.
According to local media reports, one of the buses was returning from the town of Agua Caliente, in the department of Ocotepeque, after dropping off migrants traveling to the United States, while the other was covering the Lempira-Santa Rosa route.
"I wasn't driving the bus, I had given it over to the assistant. He slammed on the brake and the tires gave way," said the driver of the bus that had dropped off the migrants.
According to the testimony of some passengers, one of the buses was speeding so much that there was "fear" among the riders.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro expressed her condolences to the families of the victims.
"My condolences to the families of the victims and solidarity for the speedy recovery of the injured. I have instructed the relevant teams and agencies to provide all support at this difficult time," she said on X.
Defense Minister Jose Manuel Zelaya said all rescue agencies are at the site, including an Air Force helicopter to transport the injured. â–

BRASILIA, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Two explosions about 20 seconds apart occurred near Brazil's Supreme Federal Court in Brasilia on Wednesday, killing one man, local authorities reported.
The first explosion happened when a car trunk caught fire and exploded in a parking lot near the Chamber of Deputies, followed by a second blast in front of the court building, according to the federal military fire department.
The Federal Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were in plenary sessions when the explosions occurred, prompting an immediate evacuation of the buildings.
Currently, the affected area has been cordoned off. Firefighters, along with military personnel, are searching the surrounding area for additional explosives.
Reports indicate that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had already left the presidential palace when the explosions took place. The cause of the incident remains under investigation. â–

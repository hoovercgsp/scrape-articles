PANAMA CITY, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Haitian government has condemned a deadly attack by the "Gran Grif" gang in the town of Pont-Sande, in the Artibonite department in Haiti, which left at least 70 people dead, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said Friday.
In a statement on social media, Prime Minister Garry Conille's office expressed "deep indignation" over the assault, calling it an act of "indescribable brutality." The attack targeted civilians, including women and children, and caused numerous injuries.
"This violence against innocent civilians is unacceptable and demands an urgent response," the statement read. The government vowed to pursue the attackers and bring them to justice, pledging international cooperation to restore peace in the region.
UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen al Kheetan confirmed Friday that at least 70 people had been killed in the attack, marking another tragic episode in Haiti's ongoing crisis of violence.
"We are horrified by Thursday's gang attacks in the town of Pont-Sonde in Haiti's Artibonite department," al Kheetan said in a statement. "Members of the 'Gran Grif' gang opened fire with automatic rifles on the population, killing at least 70 people, including 10 women and three infants."
According to the UN official, 16 of the injured remain in critical condition, including two gang members shot by Haitian security forces. Over 45 houses and 34 vehicles were set on fire, forcing many local residents to flee the area. â–

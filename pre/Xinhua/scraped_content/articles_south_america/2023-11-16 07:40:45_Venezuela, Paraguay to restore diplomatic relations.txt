CARACAS, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Paraguay announced on Wednesday they are restoring diplomatic relations, following talks between presidents of the two countries.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his Paraguayan counterpart Santiago Pena also agreed in their talks to the "reciprocal accreditation of ambassadors in the coming days," said a joint statement issued by the foreign ministries of the two countries.
"Both parties have committed to restarting bilateral relations with full respect for the fundamental principles of equal rights, self-determination of peoples, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and solidarity," the statement said.
The two leaders also ratified the principles of Latin American integration and unity, as well as interest in preserving the "natural friendship and solidarity between our peoples," said the statement.
Diplomatic relations between the two South American countries were broken in January 2019 by then Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez, who also ordered the closing of the country's embassy in Caracas.
Benitez decided to break off ties with Venezuela after Maduro was sworn in for a second term amid a power struggle in Venezuela, according to media reports. â–

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Three Brazilian top flight clubs have called on the country's football association to suspend their league matches for at least 20 days because of severe floods in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.
Internacional, Gremio and Juventude made the joint request on Monday as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked Congress to recognize a state of emergency.
At least 83 people have been killed over the past seven days as a result of the heavy rains while another 111 are reported missing.
"The absolute priority at this moment is to support thousands of people who have been hit," Internacional said in a statement. "We ask for understanding, solidarity, empathy and support at such a delicate and extraordinary moment."
Large swathes of state capital Porto Alegre were inundated, rendering the stadiums and training facilities of Internacional and Gremio unusable.
The three clubs had their weekend matches in Brazil's Serie A championship suspended. The Brazilian Football Confederation did not immediately respond to the suspension request.
Local officials said more than 80,000 people had been forced to abandon their homes while at least 15,000 had taken refuge in schools, community centers and makeshift shelters.
Rio Grande do Sul governor Eduardo Leite said on Monday that the death toll could rise in the coming days as rescue efforts continue. â–

BUENOS AIRES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentina on Thursday came one step closer to joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
At a ceremony held during the opening session of the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris, OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann formally delivered the OECD Accession Roadmap to Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino.
In a speech to the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, Mondino expressed the South American country's "gratitude and satisfaction" at embarking on the process.
Argentina wants to "focus on a system based on rules, not only for the greater well-being of our citizens, but to consolidate the agenda for freedom that Argentina is carrying out at the moment," she said.
The South American nation aspires to "carry out rigorous coordination as requested by the OECD in this process and we hope to have a qualitative change in better public policies that our country needs," she added.
"The Ministerial Council Meeting is the highest level forum organized by the OECD, with the attendance of the ministers of finance, economy, foreign affairs, trade and other government departments of member and associated countries, as well as representatives of other international organizations," said the ministry. â–

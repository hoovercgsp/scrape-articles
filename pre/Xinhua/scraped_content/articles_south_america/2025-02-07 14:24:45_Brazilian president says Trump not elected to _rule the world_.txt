BRASILIA, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump was elected to govern the United States, not "to rule the world."
In an interview with two radio stations based in the northeastern state of Bahia, Lula said, "I respect the election of President Trump who was elected by the American people to govern the United States," but "he was not elected to rule the world."
The U.S. president has to maintain "democratic and civilized" relations with the rest of the world, Lula noted, with reference to Trump's intention to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
Trump said Tuesday at a press conference that the United States will take ownership of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it after Palestinians are relocated elsewhere.
The Brazilian president also criticized the United States for promoting itself as "a symbol of democracy and 'sheriff' of the world," describing Trump's statements on the occupation of certain countries and territories as "provocations." â–

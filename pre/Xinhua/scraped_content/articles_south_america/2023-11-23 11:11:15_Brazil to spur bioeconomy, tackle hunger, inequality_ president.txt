RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will promote an initiative to spur bioeconomy and set up working groups to tackle hunger, inequality and climate change when it takes the Group of 20 (G20) presidency on Dec. 1, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Wednesday.
"We will seek concrete results that generate benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable across the planet. The G20 will help boost ongoing multilateral initiatives," Lula said during the Virtual G20 Leaders' Summit.
It is necessary to "recover the three dimensions of sustainable development and accelerate the pace of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda" for Sustainable Development spearheaded by the United Nations, he said.
The motto of Brazil's G20 presidency will be "building a just world and a sustainable planet," the president said.
Brazil will host the 30th UN Conference of Parties on Climate Change in 2025, to which it intends to bring "an ambitious climate agenda that guarantees the sustainability of the planet and people's dignity," said Lula.
However, that will only be possible by seriously addressing indebtedness, access to finance and progressive taxation mechanisms on international agendas, he said. â–

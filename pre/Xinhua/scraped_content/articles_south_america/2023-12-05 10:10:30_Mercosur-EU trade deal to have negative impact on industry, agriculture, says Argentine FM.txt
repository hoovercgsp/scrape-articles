BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero on Monday described the Mercosur-EU trade agreement as "bad," as it will have "a negative impact on industry and agricultural exports" in the region.
Mercosur, a Spanish abbreviation for the Southern Common Market, is a South American trade block consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
"Our administration has always proposed that (the agreement) be reopened because it does not reflect a balance where the two blocs both win," Cafiero said in a statement.
If the deal "is implemented as it is, exports would have to be restricted. It is a bad agreement," he said. â–

SAO PAULO, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were killed, and 12 others arrested Wednesday in a police operation targeting a criminal ring in a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro, local authorities said.
The Rio de Janeiro Public Security Secretariat said an operation was launched to combat extortion and money laundering linked to Comando Vermelho, one of Brazil's most powerful criminal groups, sparking clashes with suspected members.
The exchange of fire left three suspected criminals dead while one police officer was injured, local media reported.
Residents said members of the criminal group blocked streets with barricades and spread oil on the pavement to stop the police, according to the reports.
The police operation forced the closure of two primary healthcare clinics in the area and caused several bus lines to be rerouted. â–

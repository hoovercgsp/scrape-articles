CARACAS, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) on Tuesday strongly condemned recent comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who hinted at the possibility of taking control of the Panama Canal.
The Panama Canal is a vital international waterway protected by international law and historic agreements, including the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, the alliance said in an official statement issued in Caracas.
These treaties affirm that the canal is an integral part of Panamanian territory, the statement said.
ALBA-TCP described Trump's remarks as an act of aggression against Panama's sovereignty, warning that such statements represent a threat not only to Panama, but to the broader Latin American and Caribbean region.
The alliance expressed its full support for Panama in defending its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and right to self-determination.
It also reiterated its steadfast solidarity with Panama's government, calling Trump's comments a renewed affront to Latin American sovereignty.
The Panama Canal was returned to Panamanian control by the United States in 1999 according to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 under pressure from the Panamanian people. â–

LA PAZ, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Bolivian President Evo Morales said Tuesday that he is the target of a "lawfare" campaign to prevent his candidacy in next year's presidential elections.
The allegation came a day after the prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant when Morales failed to appear to testify as part of an investigation into charges of human trafficking and aggravated statutory rape.
Morales, who was president from 2006 to 2019, denied the charges and said his constitutional rights, including being presumed innocent until proven guilty, were being violated.
Bolivian Attorney General Roger Mariaca on Monday said authorities will request a six-month detention of the ex-president while the investigation continues. â–

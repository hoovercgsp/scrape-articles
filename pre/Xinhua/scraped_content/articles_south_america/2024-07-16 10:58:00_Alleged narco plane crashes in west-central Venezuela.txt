CARACAS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft suspected of being used to traffic drugs crashed in west-central Venezuela's Portuguesa state, Domingo Hernandez Larez, the general commander of the Strategic Operational Command of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, said on Monday.
The plane tried to evade interception by Venezuelan military aircraft after local authorities detected its illegal entry into the Venezuelan airspace, he said in a post on social media.
"Next to the aircraft, they located a deceased crew member and items such as a Mexican passport and a U.S. flying license," said Larez, adding that materials indicating the aircraft was used for drug trafficking were also found.
When the aircraft's illegal entry was detected, it was declared a hostile target, he said.
The commander added that air interdiction and interception were ordered since the aircraft did not identify itself, turned off its locator and transponder, and hid its identification plates.
The pilot ignored the various steps taken by the Venezuelan Armed Forces and attempted a forced landing, which led to the accident, Larez said. â–

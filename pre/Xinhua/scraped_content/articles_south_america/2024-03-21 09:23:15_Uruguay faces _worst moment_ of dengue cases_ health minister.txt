MONTEVIDEO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay faces the "worst moment" in its history with a record number of indigenous dengue cases, Health Minister Karina Rando said Wednesday.
"So far, historically, it's the worst time. This does not mean that we cannot get worse in the coming weeks," the minister said, after meeting with President Luis Lacalle Pou to analyze the epidemiological situation in the South American country.
In its latest epidemiological report published Tuesday, the Health Ministry reported 21 cases of indigenous dengue fever and 78 imported cases, surpassing the domestic case record of the worst outbreak of the disease in 2016.
The minister called on society to cooperate by implementing measures needed to curb insect breeding and recommended the use of insect repellents, especially for people traveling abroad.
On March 5, Rando announced that Uruguay was registering "dengue virus circulation" after two indigenous cases were confirmed earlier this month for the first time in more than a year. â–

BOGOTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two people died on Wednesday when their light aircraft crashed in northern Colombia's Atlantico department, police sources said.
Col. John Urrea, head of the Atlantico Police, told local media that police officers and firefighters were working together to retrieve the bodies of the unidentified victims, in a rural area of San Juan de Acosta, a town in the Atlantico department.
"The first people who arrived (at the scene) are area residents who notified through the single emergency hotline. When the relief agencies arrived, the crashed plane and two bodies were found inside," he said.
While the causes of the accident have yet to be determined, poor weather conditions may have played a role, he added.
On Tuesday, the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies forecast heavy rain for the department and other regions. â–

SAO PAULO, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is "alert and oriented" following Tuesday's emergency surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, according to a medical bulletin Saturday morning.
The 79-year-old president is eating normally and walking at the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo and will undergo further blood tests, but no additional diagnostic imaging tests are scheduled.
According to his doctors, Lula is recovering in intermediate care and is expected to be discharged soon to return to work next week.
On Friday, the president shared a video on social media showing him walking in the hospital hall, talking with a doctor and chatting with his wife, Rosangela da Silva. In a post on X, he wrote that he feels "strong and well."
After complaining of a severe headache, Lula was admitted for emergency surgery when a hematoma was found between his brain and meningeal membrane.
Doctors confirmed that there were no injuries or other consequences from the hematoma.
The issue was linked to Lula's fall at the presidential residence, the Palacio da Alvorada, in late October when he hurt the back of his head and received five stitches, forcing him to cancel several commitments, including his trip to the BRICS summit in Russia. â–

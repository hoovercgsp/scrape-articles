BRASILIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday hailed the decision of Spain, Ireland and Norway to recognize Palestinian statehood, a measure he said will have "a positive impact on peace and stability in the region."
"The joint decision of Spain, Norway and Ireland to recognize Palestine as a State is historic," Lula da Silva posted on social media.
The decision, he said, is historic for two reasons: first, "it does justice in relation to the claim of an entire country, recognized by more than 140 countries, to its right to self-determination," and second, "it will have a positive impact in support of the efforts towards peace and stability in the region."
Peace and stability "will only occur when the existence of an independent Palestinian state is guaranteed," he added.
Lula da Silva noted that Brazil was one of the first countries in Latin America to back Palestinian independence, when it recognized the state of Palestine in 2010.
Norway, Ireland and Spain announced on Wednesday that they would officially recognize Palestine as a state. â–

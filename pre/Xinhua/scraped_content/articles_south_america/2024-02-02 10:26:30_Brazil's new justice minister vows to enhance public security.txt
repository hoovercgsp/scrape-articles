BRASILIA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Minister of Justice Ricardo Lewandowski assumed office on Thursday, pledging to safeguard public security.
In his inaugural speech, the former Supreme Court justice linked the issue of public security to social problems.
Lewandowski became a member of the federal Supreme Court in March 2006 and retired in April 2023, one month before his 75th birthday, the maximum age allowed by law.
"It is our obligation and the Brazilian people expect the Ministry of Justice to pay special attention to public safety, which along with health is one of the citizens' major concerns," the minister said.
Lewandowski considered organized crime as one of his main challenges, saying that "there are no easy solutions" to the problem.
The new justice minister praised his predecessor's work in combating organized crime, vowing to deepen the intelligence system during his tenure. â–

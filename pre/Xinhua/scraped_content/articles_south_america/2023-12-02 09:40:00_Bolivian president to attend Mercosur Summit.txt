LA PAZ, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia's President Luis Arce is set to participate in the Mercosur (Southern Common Market) Summit of Heads of State scheduled for Dec. 7 in Brazil, following Bolivia's recent incorporation as a full member of the bloc.
"The president will be there next week, we are adjusting the agenda ... for him to participate in the Mercosur Summit in Rio de Janeiro," Deputy Communication Minister Gabriela Alcon said Friday at a press conference.
Bolivia's accession to Mercosur was approved in 2015 by member countries Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, but each member country's respective legislature had to ratify its application for membership and Brazil was the last to do so on Nov. 28.
Alcon underscored the strategic importance of Bolivia's full membership in the South American integration bloc and highlighted the collaboration and coordination efforts of bloc countries, especially Brazil.
"We once again thank and salute all the efforts of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of Brazil's Senate and all the approval ... this news is important for the country," said Alcon. â–

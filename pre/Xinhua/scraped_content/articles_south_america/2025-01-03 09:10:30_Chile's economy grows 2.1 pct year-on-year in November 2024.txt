SANTIAGO, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chile's economy grew by 2.1 percent in November 2024 compared to the same month in the previous year, the Central Bank of Chile reported Thursday.
According to the report, the Monthly Economic Activity Index (Imacec) saw an increase due to growth across all sectors, with the services sector standing out as a key driver.
The central bank's bulletin also noted a 0.3-percent rise in the seasonally adjusted series compared to the previous month, driven mainly by industrial activity.
By sector, goods production grew 2.7 percent year-on-year, driven by strong performances in agriculture, forestry, and copper mining, while the industrial sector saw a more modest increase of 1.2 percent.
Meanwhile, commercial activity expanded by 4.8 percent year-on-year, fueled by both retail and wholesale trade, with growth coming from both physical stores and e-commerce.
The services sector grew 1.4 percent year-on-year, driven by strong demand in personal services such as healthcare, education, and transportation.
The report also indicated that the non-mining Imacec registered a 2-percent annual growth in November, with a 0.4-percent seasonally adjusted increase compared to the previous month. â–

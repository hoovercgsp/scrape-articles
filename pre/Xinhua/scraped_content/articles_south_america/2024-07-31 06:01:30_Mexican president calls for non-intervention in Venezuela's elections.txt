MEXICO CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday called on the international community to avoid taking an interventionist stance regarding the presidential elections in Venezuela.
At his regular daily press conference, Lopez Obrador recommended waiting for the final outcome of the elections, which were held Sunday in the South American country.
"It is a matter of waiting for the results and also respecting the self-determination of the people," the president told reporters at the National Palace in Mexico City.
"Don't the governments of other countries ... have things to do? Why do they have to get involved in the affairs of other countries? Why the interference?" he asked.
Lopez Obrador also questioned the role of the Organization of American States, urging the organization to stop engaging in "politicking."
In the name of democracy, "atrocities are committed," the president warned, referring to governments keen to take sides in Venezuela.
On Monday, Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of Sunday's elections. â–

CARACAS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- As of Sunday morning, 95 percent of polling stations in Venezuela are operational, accommodating voters in the presidential election for the 2025-2031 term, National Electoral Council (CNE) President Elvis Amoroso announced Sunday.
In a press conference, the electoral official said the process has commenced as usual across the Venezuelan territory, adding that 100 percent of all technical staff are present at the voting centers.
Amoroso said that today's presidential election involves 10 candidates, 38 political parties, and more than 1,000 national and international observers.
In his first report of the day to accredited media covering the election, Amoroso also said that the only requirement to vote in Venezuela is to present a national ID card, even if expired.
He expressed gratitude to "each CNE official, the electoral board members, and the military personnel deployed across Venezuela" for safeguarding and transporting electoral materials.
The CNE president noted that preliminary updates on the election process will be provided in the coming hours. â–

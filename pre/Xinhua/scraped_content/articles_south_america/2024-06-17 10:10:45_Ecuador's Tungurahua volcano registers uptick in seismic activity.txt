QUITO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano, situated in the country's central Andes region, registered high-frequency seismic activity Sunday, accompanied by lahar -- fast-moving mudflow and rock debris --- on its slopes, according to the country's scientific institute.
The uptick in volcanic activity occurred around 04:30 a.m. local time (0930 GMT) and was detected by seismic stations located on the flanks of the volcano, the Ecuadorian Geophysical Institute of the National Polytechnic School said in a report.
"Through satellite images, rain can be seen in the sector and weather forecasts indicate that the rain will continue during the following hours, so lahar may continue to be generated as a result," the report said.
The institute advised people to stay away from riverbeds near the volcano, which stands at 5,023 meters above sea level and has numerous towns situated on its slopes.
Tungurahua is one of the most active volcanoes in the South American country after it came to life in 1999. Its eruption in 2006 left six people dead in a village devastated by lava. â–

CARACAS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas announced here on Monday their decision to hold a new round of peace talks in May.
"From May 20 to 25, 2024, the peace talks between the government of the Republic of Colombia and the ELN will take place in Caracas," said Vera Grabe, head of the Colombian government delegation.
The head of the ELN delegation, Pablo Beltran, expressed his gratitude to the Venezuelan people and government for "hosting the effort towards the Dialogue Table for Peace."
In their joint statement, the two sides expressed their solidarity with Mexico over Ecuador's raid of its embassy in Quito earlier this month.
In October 2022, Colombian President Gustavo Petro's administration and the ELN guerrilla group agreed to start a new round of peace negotiations. â–

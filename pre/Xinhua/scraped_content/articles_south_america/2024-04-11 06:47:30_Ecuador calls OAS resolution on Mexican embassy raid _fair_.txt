QUITO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Gabriela Sommerfeld on Wednesday described as "fair" a resolution by the Organization of American States (OAS) that strongly condemns the country for ordering a police raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, according to local media.
"It is a fair resolution, where we also see the lack of compliance in the use of the diplomatic headquarters, so we are moving forward," said Sommerfeld.
"As Ecuador, we are also going to defend our version of the events," Sommerfeld told reporters at the National Assembly, where she reported to lawmakers on the April 5 raid that led Mexico to sever diplomatic ties with Ecuador.
Asked if Ecuador was willing to dialogue with Mexico to overcome the impasse, Sommerfeld said apologizing for the incident currently "is not on the table."
Earlier in the day, the OAS approved the resolution to "strongly condemn the intrusion into the facilities of the Mexican Embassy in Ecuador and the acts of violence carried out against the integrity and dignity of the diplomatic staff of the mission."
The document was approved at the end of an extraordinary meeting of the OAS Permanent Council, convened at the request of Bolivia and Colombia.
A total of 29 countries voted in favor, one (Ecuador) opposed, and one (El Salvador) abstained.
Ecuadorian police stormed the Mexican embassy in Quito on April 5 to arrest Glas, hours after Mexico granted him political asylum. Mexico has said it will appeal to the International Court of Justice to intercede in the incident. â–

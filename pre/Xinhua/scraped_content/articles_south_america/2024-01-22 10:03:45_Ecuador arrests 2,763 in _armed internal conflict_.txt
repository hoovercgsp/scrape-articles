QUITO, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of people detained in the ongoing "armed internal conflict" in Ecuador has risen to 2,763, the authorities announced Sunday.
Among those detained, 158 have been charged with "terrorism," said the Ecuador government in its latest report on a series of attacks and violence that have been plaguing the country since Jan. 9.
According to the report, the detentions occurred in 31,539 operations carried out by the police and the armed forces on Jan. 9-21.
The action against the "terrorists" and criminal groups is aimed at "restoring the peace and security that citizens demand," said the report.
On Jan. 9, organized crime groups in Ecuador issued threats of "war," prompting the country's president to declare a state of "armed internal conflict" and authorize military operations against these groups. â–

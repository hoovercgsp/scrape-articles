CARACAS, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has recalled its ambassador to Spain, Gladys Gutierrez, for consultations in response to remarks made by Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said on Thursday.
Gil condemned Robles' comments, calling them "insolent, meddling, and disrespectful" in a statement shared on Telegram.
Robles earlier referred to the Venezuelan government as a "dictatorship."
Venezuela's Foreign Ministry has summoned Spain's ambassador to Caracas, Ramon Santos Martinez, to appear at the ministry on Friday.
Additionally, Jorge Rodriguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly, on Wednesday called on the Foreign Affairs Committee to urge the executive branch to sever all diplomatic, commercial, and consular ties with Spain.
The diplomatic fallout came amid controversy surrounding Venezuela's July 28 presidential election, with the main opposition coalition, the United States, the EU, and several regional countries raising concerns over alleged irregularities.
The Venezuelan government, however, said these accusations are part of a U.S.-backed plot to undermine the election results. â–

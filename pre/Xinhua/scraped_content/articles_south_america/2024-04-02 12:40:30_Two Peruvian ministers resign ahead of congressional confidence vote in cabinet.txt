LIMA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Peru's ministers of the Interior, Victor Torres, and of Women and Vulnerable Populations, Nancy Tolentino, resigned on Monday, just days before the new prime minister, Gustavo Adrianzen, heads to Congress to request a vote of confidence in the cabinet.
Torres told local media he resigned due to family reasons, and stressed he was not being removed from office or censured.
Torres had come under scrutiny regarding the role of the National Police in a raid on President Dina Boluarte's home over the weekend.
Shortly after his resignation was made public, Tolentino announced her resignation via social media.
The resignations came shortly before the prime minister was set to seek a vote of confidence in the cabinet on Thursday, only weeks after he assumed office on March 6 following the resignation of his predecessor, Alberto Otarola. â–

LIMA, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- Peru's government declared three days of national mourning after former President Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) died Wednesday from cancer, the state-run daily "El Peruano" said Thursday.
An executive order issued by Peru's President Dina Boluarte and endorsed by Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen, when planning "the corresponding funeral honors" for Fujimori, called for national mourning from Sept. 12 to 14.
As part of the honors, the national flag will fly at half-mast at all public buildings, military installations, bases, ships and other state entities.
Fujimori, who had been out of prison since December 2023 after having been granted a pardon, died Wednesday around 6:00 p.m. local time "following a long battle against cancer," his daughter Keiko Fujimori confirmed.
The ex-president's remains will lie in state through Saturday at the Museum of the Nation, located at the headquarters of the Culture Ministry in the city of Lima, and from there will be taken to the Campo Fe Cemetery in Huachipa for burial.
Keiko Fujimori expressed gratitude for the "support" and "great displays of solidarity in these painful times." â–

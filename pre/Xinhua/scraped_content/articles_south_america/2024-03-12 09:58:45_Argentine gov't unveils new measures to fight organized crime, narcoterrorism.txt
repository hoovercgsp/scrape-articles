BUENOS AIRES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's government on Monday proposed new measures to combat organized crime, money laundering, and narcoterrorism in Rosario, a city where the murder rate is five times higher than the national average.
As part of an "Anti-Mafia Law" to be submitted to the National Congress, the proposed measures include applying anti-terrorism laws to organized crime and imposing harsher penalties for violence intended to intimidate or sow terror.
On Sunday, the government announced the deployment of army troops to crack down on crime in Rosario, located in east-central Santa Fe province.
Anti-crime strategies launched two months ago in Rosario "reduced the business of drug traffickers. And today they are trying to get us out of the way with narco-terrorist actions," Patricia Bullrich, Argentina's security minister, said in a post on social media platform X. â–

CARACAS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Participants from member countries of Latin American regional bloc Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) and the Venezuelan government gathered here Wednesday in an event to show solidarity with the people of Palestine.
The participants raised a giant flag of Palestine atop one of the highest mountain peaks in Caracas at Waraira Repano National Park.
The ceremony took place on the 76th anniversary of the Nakba, or Catastrophe, referring to the Palestinian exodus.
Executive Secretary of ALBA-TCP Jorge Arreaza said in a speech that the bloc's 10 member countries recently voted at the UN General Assembly in favor of the full recognition of Palestinian statehood.
He called for "permanent action" from governments and people around the world to press for the "free existence of the Palestinian state."
Palestinian Ambassador in Caracas Fadi Alzaben thanked Venezuela and the ALBA-TCP bloc for the "symbolic act" of flying "our Palestinian flag at majestic Waraira Repano." â–

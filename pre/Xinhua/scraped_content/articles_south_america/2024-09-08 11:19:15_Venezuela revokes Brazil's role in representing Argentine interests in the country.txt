CARACAS, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil can no longer represent Argentina's diplomatic interests in Venezuela, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement released on Saturday.
The statement said the decision was based on evidence that the Brazilian mission had been used for "planning terrorist activities."
It also accused individuals inside the embassy of plotting "assassination attempts against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Vice President Delcy Rodriguez."
Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential elections on July 29, and called on the governments of Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay to withdraw their diplomatic staff accredited in the country, accusing the governments of those seven countries of "interference" in its internal affairs. â–

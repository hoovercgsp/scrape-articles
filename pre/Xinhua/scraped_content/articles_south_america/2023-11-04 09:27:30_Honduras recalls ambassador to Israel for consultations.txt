TEGUCIGALPA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Honduras on Friday recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations due to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip, said Honduran Foreign Affairs Minister Enrique Reina.
"Given the serious humanitarian situation the Palestinian civilian population suffered in the Gaza Strip, the government of President Xiomara Castro has decided to immediately recall Mr. Roberto Martinez, ambassador of the Republic of Honduras in Israel, to Tegucigalpa for consultations," Reina posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
Honduras wants a ceasefire to be declared in the Gaza Strip and a humanitarian corridor to be opened to allow the supply of aid and for peace negotiations to begin, he said.
"Depending on how the situation in Gaza evolves, the positions considered appropriate will be taken," he added.
The conflict between Israel and Hamas has killed more than 9,200 Palestinians in Gaza and at least 1,400 Israelis, according to official figures from both sides. â–

BRASILIA, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil unveiled on Tuesday an investment program to develop sustainable and digital agro-industrial chains.
The program, worth 546.6 billion reals (about 90.3 billion U.S. dollars), was announced at a ceremony presided over by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and attended by high-ranking officials and representatives from agribusiness, industry, machinery, and equipment fields.
During the event, Lula signed an executive order aimed at developing family farming and agroecology to promote research and innovation in these areas.
Of the total investment, 250.2 billion reals (about 41.4 billion dollars) will come from public-sector funds earmarked for credit lines. The private sector plans to invest 296.3 billion reals (about 48.95 billion dollars) through 2029.
The program is part of the New Industry Brazil initiative's Mission 1, which seeks to ensure the country's food and energy security while boosting economic growth between 2026 and 2033. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday criticized the organizers of a general strike planned for Wednesday, saying they aim to keep the country "in backwardness, in the past and in decadence."
Argentina's General Confederation of Labor (CGT), along with other social organizations, called for the strike to protest a series of regulations Milei has proposed to deregulate the economy and rein in public spending.
Labor unions, the Peronist party that governed the country between 2019 and 2023, and other sectors of the population are pushing back against the measures, with successive pot-banging demonstrations expressing their rejection.
Defending his policy, Milei has said there are "two Argentinas," local media reported Monday, citing state news agency Telam.
Part of the country "wants to remain in backwardness, in the past and in decadence," while his administration seeks to adopt "another model" that will place Argentina on "the path to being developed," Milei said.
A range of labor unions are taking part in the general strike, including transport, construction and public-sector workers, with protesters marching to Congress to make their demands.
However, public transit is set to operate until 7:00 p.m. local time to allow protesters to get to where they need to go.
The government, meanwhile, has said it will deduct the day's wages from public-sector employees who miss work to take part in the strike. â–

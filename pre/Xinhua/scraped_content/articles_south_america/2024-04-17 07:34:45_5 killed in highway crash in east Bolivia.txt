LA PAZ, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and more than 35 others were injured on Tuesday when a bus crashed on a highway and plunged into a ravine more than 20 meters deep in east Bolivia, local authorities said.
Emergency and police personnel were dispatched to the accident site in the town of Quine, the department of Santa Cruz.
According to the transportation company that operated the bus, the bus left the department of Potosi in the southwest on Monday afternoon for the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
The bus fell into a ravine near Quine, five kilometers from the town of Mataral, apparently due to lack of visibility, although the possibility that the driver fell asleep was also being investigated, according to local media reports. â–

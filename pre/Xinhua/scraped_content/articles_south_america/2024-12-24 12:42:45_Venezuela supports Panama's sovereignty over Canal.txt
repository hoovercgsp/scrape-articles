CARACAS, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela supports Panama's sovereignty over the Panama Canal, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
Venezuela reaffirms its unwavering commitment to Panama's sovereignty over the canal, which was taken back by the heroic efforts of then-Panamanian President Omar Torrijos, the ministry said.
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said that his government might regain control of the canal because of "ridiculous" fees charged on U.S. ships.
Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino said that every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent area belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama.
"The sovereignty and independence of our country are non-negotiable," said the Panamanian president. â–

TEGUCIGALPA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Honduran President Xiomara Castro announced on Tuesday that her government reached an agreement with the United States to continue a bilateral extradition treaty.
"I have reached an agreement with the new United States administration so that the Extradition Treaty continues with the necessary safeguards for the State of Honduras," Castro posted on social platform X.
Castro said the pact will be carried out "objectively" to safeguard the integrity of Honduras' armed forces and Honduran sovereignty.
Additional details on the agreement will be provided by Honduran Foreign Affairs Minister Enrique Reina, she added.
The announcement marks a significant turnaround since the Honduran government decided on Aug. 28, 2024 to terminate the treaty, after U.S. ambassador to Honduras Laura Dogu was denounced for interfering in the internal affairs of Honduras.
Dogu had criticized a visit by high-ranking Honduran military officers to Venezuela. The Honduran government considered the criticism as an unacceptable act of interference.
The recent negotiation suggests an easing of tensions in bilateral ties and a commitment to respect Honduran sovereignty and ensure transparency in the application of the treaty. â–

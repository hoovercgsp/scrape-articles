LA PAZ, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia signed strategic agreements Tuesday with three transnational companies on technological projects to exploit lithium at three salt flats, including Empexa, as part of the national plan of metal industrialization.
Presiding the signing ceremony, Bolivian President Luis Arce described the development as an "important step" toward implementing new technologies that can make the most of Bolivia's evaporite deposits rich in minerals.
The government's strategy, he said, does not seek to concentrate lithium exploitation in a single company, but rather to attract various technologies that adapt to the unique characteristics of Bolivia's salt flats, thereby guaranteeing greater quality and productivity. â–

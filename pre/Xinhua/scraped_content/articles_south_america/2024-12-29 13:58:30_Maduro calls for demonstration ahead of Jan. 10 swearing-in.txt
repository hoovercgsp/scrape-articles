CARACAS, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has called for his supporters to take to the streets "to defend the vote" as he prepares to be sworn in for the 2025-2031 presidential term on Jan. 10.
"In every arena, we are defending our right to peace, stability, and tranquility. Let no one be mistaken!" Maduro wrote on social media on Saturday.
The call came amid heightened political tensions in Venezuela. The opposition coalition Democratic Unity Platform (PUD) claimed that its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, was the "true" winner of the election and has announced plans to hold his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 10.
The PUD is backed by several Western countries led by the United States.
Maduro said that the social and political movements supporting his administration "will remain in constant mobilization, with joy and in various forms," adding that "on Jan. 10, the people's forces will be present."
"This Jan. 10, Venezuelans will take the oath with the joy that defines us, for our cause and our homeland. What lies ahead in 2025 is monumental!" Maduro said.
The president said that "those who seek to diminish us have failed to suppress the indomitable strength of the people," as he urged supporters to mobilize in defense of their right to vote. â–

BOGOTA, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian air force plane landed in Bogota Wednesday with 105 Colombian nationals deported from the United States, marking the third flight of its kind this week, the Colombian Foreign Ministry said.
"Deportees arrived in the morning from San Diego, California," the ministry said in a statement, adding that the government remains committed to ensuring the rights and dignity of citizens abroad.
Two previous flights landed on Tuesday, bringing back 201 Colombian nationals in total.
After Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused entry of U.S. military planes carrying handcuffed deportees on Jan. 26, a high-level bilateral meeting was held in Washington, D.C., to reach an agreement on their safe and dignified return, said the ministry.
Astrid Caceres, the director of the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare, told reporters that an initial investigation shows the U.S. treatment of Colombian deportees has been "degrading."
Authorities plan to look into complaints made by children who said they were handcuffed and forced by U.S. authorities to get up at three in the morning to bathe with cold water, she said. â–

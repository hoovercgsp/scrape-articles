SAO PAULO, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane crashed in the interior of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo on Friday, killing all 61 aboard, the airline company Voepass confirmed.
The airline said the number of death was 61, not 62 as initially reported.
In a statement, Voepass said the plane that crashed in the city of Vinhedo was carrying 57 passengers and four crew members, and none of them survived the accident.
The plane of the Brazilian regional airline was traveling from the city of Cascavel in the southern state of Parana to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo.

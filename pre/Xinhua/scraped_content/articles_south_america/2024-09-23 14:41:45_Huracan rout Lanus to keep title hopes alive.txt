BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- Huracan climbed to second in Argentina's Primera Division standings on Sunday by romping to a 3-0 home win over Lanus.
Alan Sonora opened the scoring in the sixth minute at El Palacio before Rodrigo Echeverria and Eric Ramirez added second-half goals.
Huracan are now only three points behind leaders Velez Sarsfield while Lanus dropped to 15th in the 28-team standings, eight points further back.
"This leaves us in a good position and hopeful of bigger things ahead," Huracan manager Frank Kudelka told reporters after the match.
Meanwhile, Talleres Cordoba also kept their title hopes intact with a 2-0 home victory over Racing Club, despite playing for more than an hour with only 10 men.
Valentin Depietri gave his side the lead in the 17th minute but Talleres suffered a blow just after the half hour when Franco Moyano was shown a straight red card for a bad tackle on Bruno Zuculini.
Despite their numerical disadvantage, the hosts defended resolutely thereafter to claim their seventh win of the campaign.
The result leaves Talleres third in the standings, behind Huracan on goal difference, while Racing are eighth, three points further adrift.
In other fixtures on Sunday, Argentinos Juniors drew 0-0 at Independiente, Belgrano won 4-2 at Atletico Tucuman, and Platense prevailed 1-0 at home to Rosario Central. â–

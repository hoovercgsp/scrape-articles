RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela international winger Jefferson Savarino scored twice as Botafogo all but secured a place in the Copa Libertadores final with a 5-0 home win over Penarol on Wednesday.
After a goalless first half in the semifinal first leg, the Brazilian side took the lead in the 51st minute through Savarino, who dinked a shot into the far corner after Luiz Henrique's through ball.
Alexander Barboza doubled the lead four minutes later by slotting home from the edge of the six-yard box, and Savarino made it 3-0 when his first-time effort deflected in off goalkeeper Washington Aguerre.
Henrique then combined with Brazil teammate Igor Jesus before deftly lifting a shot over the on-rushing Aguerre.
Botafogo were implacable, and Igor Jesus completed the rout by heading home 11 minutes from time after Aguerre palmed away Thiago Almada's curling effort from distance.
The decisive second leg will be played in Montevideo next Wednesday. The winner on aggregate will meet either River Plate or Atletico Mineiro in the final in Buenos Aires on November 30. â–

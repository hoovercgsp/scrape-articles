BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's government announced on Tuesday its proposal to reform immigration laws, including ending free access to medical care for foreigners at public hospitals and introducing fees for foreign students.
The reforms aim "to advance towards an orderly country that protects Argentine citizens," presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni told a press conference at the government house.
The changes would allow national universities to charge non-resident foreign students studying in the country, generating a source of funding for universities.
"Currently, one in three medical students is a foreigner," Adorni said.
The reforms would end free medical care for foreigners, with national, provincial, or municipal healthcare agencies to determine the terms of access for non-resident foreigners, including the possibility of charging fees for medical services.
"We are bidding farewell to the famous healthcare tours that are, unfortunately, so familiar in Argentina," the official said. â–

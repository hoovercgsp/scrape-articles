MEXICO CITY, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Peru international midfielder Piero Quispe scored in the last minute of stoppage time to hand Pumas UNAM a dramatic 1-0 home victory over Mazatlan in Mexico's Liga MX on Sunday.
Quispe, a 62nd-minute substitute for Jorge Ruvalcaba broke the deadlock in the 101st minute by sweeping a low first-time effort from 16 yards into the far corner.
The result leaves Pumas fifth in the 18-team Liga MX standings with 11 points from six outings, five points behind leader Club America. Mazatlan dropped to 11th with seven points.
"I didn't like the way we played, especially in the first half, but I have to highlight the attitude of the players and the reward that came as a result," Pumas manager Gustavo Lema told a post-match news conference.
"The fans had a right not to be happy because we didn't play well. We have to do better but it's a constant search. I can't fault the temperament of the players, who have never given in."
Pumas will now turn its attention to next Sunday's visit to Pachuca while Mazatlan will host Santos Laguna on Friday. â–

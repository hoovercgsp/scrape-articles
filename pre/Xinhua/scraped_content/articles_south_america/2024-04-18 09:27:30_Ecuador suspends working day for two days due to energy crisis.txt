QUITO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government on Wednesday decreed the suspension of the working day on April 18 and 19 on a national scale in response to the energy crisis facing the South American country.
The decision, which applies to the public and private sectors, was made by President Daniel Noboa through an executive decree.
According to the decree, the suspended working days will be recovered in the public sector through an additional hour during the subsequent working days, while the form of recovery in the private sector will be determined by "mutual agreement" between employers and workers.
The decision came a day after the president decreed an emergency in the electricity sector and asked Energy Minister Andrea Arrobo to resign.
Since Sunday, Ecuador has experienced unexpected and recurrent power cuts in several areas.
The energy ministry attributed the situation to the prolonged drought, minimal flow levels in the hydroelectric plants, rising temperatures and the lack of maintenance to electrical infrastructure.
A preliminary investigation indicates that officials from the ministry "intentionally concealed" information crucial to the operation of the energy system, the government said in a statement on Wednesday. â–

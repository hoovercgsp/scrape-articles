CARACAS, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday accused his Dominican counterpart Luis Abinader of being a "thief" and "bandit," after the seizure of his plane in the Dominican Republic.
Speaking at an event broadcast by the state-run television channel, Maduro claimed that Abinader, with the cooperation of local officials, facilitated U.S. authorities in seizing the aircraft.
Maduro warned that the Dominican people would eventually hold Abinader accountable.
The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was impounded by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month for violating U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and flown to Florida.
Maduro said that Venezuela reserves its right to take legal action to address the situation and reiterated his opposition to U.S. sanctions. â–

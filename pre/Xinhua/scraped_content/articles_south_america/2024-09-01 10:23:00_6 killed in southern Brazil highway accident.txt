RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 31 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed in a highway accident involving two trucks and a car in Brazil's metropolitan region of Curitiba, Parana, said the Federal Highway Police on Saturday.
The crash occurred on Friday night in Sao Jose dos Pinhais, Curitiba, when a line of vehicles had slowed down and a truck driver failed to stop in time, colliding into the car ahead. The car was then pushed into another truck, said the police.
Five passengers in the car and the truck driver who failed to brake lost their lives, they added. â–

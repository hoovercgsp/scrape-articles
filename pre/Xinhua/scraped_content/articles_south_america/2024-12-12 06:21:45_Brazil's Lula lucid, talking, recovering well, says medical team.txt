SAO PAULO, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who underwent emergency surgery Tuesday to treat an intracranial hemorrhage, is recovering well following a peaceful night's sleep in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), his doctors said Wednesday.
The president is "lucid, oriented, talking and had a good night," according to a medical report from the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in Sao Paulo, which indicated that the patient "is making favorable progress after the operation."
"The president still has a drain (to remove excess fluid) while awaiting routine tests," added the report signed by doctors Luiz Cardoso and Alvaro Sarkis, who were in charge of the hospitalization.
The 79-year-old Lula had the emergency surgery to drain a head hematoma resulting from a blow he suffered on Oct. 19 after a domestic accident at Alvorada Palace, the official presidential residence in Brasilia. At the time, he received five stitches in the back of his neck and was forced to cancel plans to travel to the leaders' summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in the Russian city of Kazan.
Roberto Kalil, the president's personal physician, said Tuesday that the president could be discharged next week and return to work normally at Alvorada Palace.
Doctors ruled out any brain injuries or other consequences as a result of the intracranial hematoma that was drained.
Part of Lula's agenda was taken on this week by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin.
According to local media, the president will resume official work from the hospital once he leaves the ICU. â–

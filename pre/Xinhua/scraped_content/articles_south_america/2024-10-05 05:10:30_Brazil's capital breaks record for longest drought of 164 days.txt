SAO PAULO, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, has set a new record for its longest dry spell, with 164 straight days without rain, the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) reported Friday.
The prolonged drought has fueled widespread wildfires and grassland burns, which have surged across various regions of the country since August.
The previous record was set in 1963, just three years after Brasilia's founding, with 163 consecutive rainless days. The city, located in Brazil's central region, is now grappling with the dual threat of extreme heat and low humidity.
Authorities have issued an "orange alert" due to the critically low humidity level of 15 percent, combined with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius.
A report from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) highlighted a 269 percent increase in wildfires in Brasilia this year compared to previous years.
Inmet forecasts relief with rain expected on Oct. 8, following Thursday's sweltering 36.8 degrees Celsius - the hottest day of the year so far.
Brasilia is situated in the Cerrado biome, a vast tropical savanna, which has seen record-breaking wildfires this year. â–

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's Undersecretary of Communication Eduardo Roust resigned on Saturday, a week after President Javier Milei appointed him to the job.
In a letter to the media, Roust said that he was quitting the position "for strictly personal reasons," according to the official Telam news agency.
"The vertigo of the digital or modern world of communications requires an unprecedented speed of information," which made his job "a little inhuman," he wrote.
Roust also apologized to his colleagues for "the lack of patience" and "many disagreements" they had, praising them for their great work. â–

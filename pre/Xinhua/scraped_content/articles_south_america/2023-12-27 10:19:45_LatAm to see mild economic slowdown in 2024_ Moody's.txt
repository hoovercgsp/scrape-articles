MEXICO CITY, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- Latin America will see a mild economic slowdown in 2024 due to risks including a potential recession, Moody's Analytics said Tuesday.
The region may make a "soft landing" in the first half of the year by effectively using economic policy tools to avoid sharp adjustments, the firm said in a report.
On the external front, regional economies could see a decline in exports due to lower global demand, especially for raw materials and semi-manufactured products.
On the domestic front, they will have to strike a balance between reining in inflation and spurring the economy to escape a "hard landing" or even a recession, said the rating agency.
It forecast Latin America's economy could grow 1.8 percent in 2024, from 2.2 percent in 2023.
The countries expected to lead growth in 2024 are Uruguay, Mexico and Peru, followed by Chile, Colombia and Brazil.
Earlier this month, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean predicted a 1.9 percent regional growth for 2024, down from the 2.2 percent for 2023. â–

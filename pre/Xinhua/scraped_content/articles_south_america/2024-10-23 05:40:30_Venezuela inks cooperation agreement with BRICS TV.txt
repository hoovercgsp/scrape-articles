CARACAS, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Minister of Communication and Information Freddy Nanez has signed a memorandum of cooperation between state-owned Venezuelan Television (VTV), Caracas-based news network Telesur and TV BRICS, VTV announced Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan.
In statements to VTV, Nanez said signing the agreement was a "big step" that allows the two channels that broadcast out of Venezuela to be part of TV BRICS, which broadcasts news from members of the BRICS bloc and their partners.
"The excitement we feel is the excitement of being in a place where we are going to be useful," said the minister, adding that another Venezuelan channel, VIVE TV, will soon be part of the cooperation agreement.
Through TV BRICS, "the true face of Venezuela, the beauty of our landscapes, the richness of our culture ... will be able to be seen, will be able to be heard, will be able to be understood," said Nanez.
There can be no economic and political integration "if there is no cultural integration first," he noted.
"The great TV BRICS family" has only one purpose, he added, "to make international communication democratic."
A Venezuelan government delegation, headed by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, is in Kazan to participate in the 16th BRICS Summit taking place Oct. 22 to 24 in the Russian city. â–

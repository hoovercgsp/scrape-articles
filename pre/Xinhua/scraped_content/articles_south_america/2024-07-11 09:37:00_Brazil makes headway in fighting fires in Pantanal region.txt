BRASILIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is making headway in fighting fires in the Pantanal region, one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands, having put out 30 of 54 blazes, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Marina Silva said Wednesday.
"We still have 24 active fires, 13 of which are already under control. Additionally, about three new fires have emerged, and we are planning to ensure they are also addressed by brigades," Silva said following a meeting to address fires and droughts in Brazil.
A total of 830 federal government professionals, along with 15 planes, 15 ships, and three military bases, are working to combat the fires in Pantanal, which lies in the states of Mato Grosso in west-central Brazil and Mato Grosso do Sul in southern Brazil.
The Federal Police is investigating the cause of the fires, Silva said. â–

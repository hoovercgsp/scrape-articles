LIMA, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people have been confirmed killed in Monday's bus accident on a highway in Peru's Corongo province, in the western Ancash region, local authorities said Tuesday.
The Regional Emergency Operations Center in Ancash said another six people were injured in the crash Monday afternoon after the bus operated by the La Perla del Altomayo transport company drove off highway PE-12A along the Tarica-Yanac tract.
The bus, which was traveling from the northern department of La Libertad to the capital Lima, plunged into a ravine about 300 meters deep, according to news radio station Radio Programas del Peru.
Yanac district Mayor Carlos Pinedo blamed the crash on the "terrible conditions" of the road, and called on the central government to improve the roadway, local media said.
The injured were taken to area hospitals for treatment. â–

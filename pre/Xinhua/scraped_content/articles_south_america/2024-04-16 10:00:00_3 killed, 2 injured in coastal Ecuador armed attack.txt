QUITO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Three people, including two police officers, were killed and two other officers were injured in an armed attack Monday on the road to Samborondon, a town in the coastal province of Guayas in southwest Ecuador, the country's Attorney General's Office (FGE) said.
According to the FGE report, the victims were shot near the town of San Gil, where two vehicles were found containing firearms and ammunition.
Criminal violence has rebounded since the expiration of a 90-day state of emergency with a curfew, designed to help authorities tackle crime.
Five people, including an underage child, were murdered in an armed attack in the Cristo del Consuelo neighborhood of the southwest city of Guayaquil on April 11, one of the most violent attacks in the country.
Early on April 7, the government declared the country is in an "internal armed conflict" and ordered the military to participate in operations against organized armed groups classified as "terrorists." â–

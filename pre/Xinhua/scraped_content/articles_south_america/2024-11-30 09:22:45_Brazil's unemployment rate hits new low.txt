RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent in the August-October period, the lowest level since 2012, said the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) on Friday.
"There was a recovery between 2017 and 2019, but in 2020, the pandemic had a severe impact on the labor market. Since then, the labor market has been recovering, especially in 2022," the agency said, reporting a record high of 103.6 million unemployed people, up by 1.5 percent from the previous three months and 3.4 percent from a year earlier.
Average real wages were up 0.8 percent in the quarter to 3,255 reais (545 U.S. dollars). â–

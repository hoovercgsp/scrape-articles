CARACAS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government on Monday severed diplomatic relations with Paraguay and recalled its diplomatic personnel from the country in protest against Paraguayan President Santiago Pena's support for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia.
"The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has decided, in full exercise of its sovereignty, to break diplomatic relations with the Republic of Paraguay and proceed with the immediate withdrawal of its accredited diplomatic personnel in that country," the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry stated in a communique.
On Sunday, the Paraguayan president expressed his support for Gonzalez Urrutia via a phone call, reaffirming recognition of him as the "winner of the presidential elections in Venezuela," held on July 28, 2024.
In response, the Venezuelan government "categorically rejected" Pena's statements, accusing the Paraguayan leader of disregarding "international law and the principle of non-intervention."
Caracas reiterated its "commitment to the defense of democracy, peace, and the self-determination of peoples," adding that "no farce orchestrated by international fascism will undermine the resolve of a people in the construction of their own destiny."
On Jan. 10, Nicolas Maduro is set to be sworn in as president for the 2025-2031 term following his victory in the recent elections. â–

LA PAZ, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought and frost have affected at least 39 municipalities in Bolivia, destroying crops and forcing 13,000 families to leave their homes, a senior official said Wednesday.
"We are expecting a significant impact due to the water shortage," Juan Carlos Calvimontes, vice civil defense minister of Bolivia, said at a press conference, adding that the drought period was just beginning.
According to a report from the Civil Defense Ministry, the drought is affecting municipalities in the Bolivian departments of Santa Cruz, La Paz, Beni and Potosi.
Meanwhile, frost and hailstorms have been wreaking havoc in 30 municipalities, impacting 32,687 families and forcing 13,448 families to be displaced.
Government officials will meet with local leaders to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian aid to those families, said Calvimontes. â–

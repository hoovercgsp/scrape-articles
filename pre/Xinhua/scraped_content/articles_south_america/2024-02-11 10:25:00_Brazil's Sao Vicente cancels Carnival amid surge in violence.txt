SAO PAULO, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian coastal city of Sao Vicente has canceled this year's Carnival festivities due to violent clashes between police and organized crime groups, which resulted in 14 deaths in the past week, local media reported.
The decision, announced by the mayor's office and published in the Official Gazette on Friday night, suspends street parties, parades, and outdoor performances. The move comes after intense operations by security forces in response to the killing of a police officer by criminal factions.
Paulo Bonavides, secretary of tourism and president of the city's Carnival 2024 Commission, cited concerns for public safety as the primary reason for the cancellation. The decision impacts the traditional annual festivities set to begin on Tuesday. â–

LIMA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Dina Boluarte swore in Gustavo Adrianzen as the new prime minister on Wednesday.
Adrianzen, a lawyer who served as Peru's permanent representative to the Organization of American States, took the oath of office at the Government Palace in Lima, where Boluarte also swore in new ministers who will make up her cabinet.
Adrianzen served as minister of justice under former president Ollanta Humala from 2011 to 2016. He replaced Alberto Otarola, who resigned as prime minister on Tuesday following a leaked recording of a phone call that appears to link him to a corruption case. â–

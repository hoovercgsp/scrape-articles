QUITO, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The eruptive activity of Ecuador's active Sangay Volcano is on the rise, marked by the occurrence of pyroclastic outflows, the Ecuadoran Geophysical Institute of the National Polytechnic School (IG-EPN) reported Sunday.
The volcano, located about 5,230 meters above sea level in an unpopulated region of the southern Amazonian province of Morona Santiago, has been in constant eruptive activity since 1628 when it last erupted.
The IG-EPN said since 05:32 a.m. local time (1032 GMT) Sunday there has been a pyroclastic density current, a phenomenon known for its abundance of ash and gases, which has the potential to lead to an augmentation of sediment in the Volcan River, subsequently affecting the Upano River.
In case of heavy rains in areas surrounding the volcano, one can expect remobilization of the material, with flows of mud and debris in the volcano's ravines, according to the institute.
The IG-EPN recommended, as a precaution, not to enter or approach the main rivers of Morona Santiago. â–

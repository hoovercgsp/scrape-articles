CARACAS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan representatives in talks with the United States said on Wednesday they have agreed to work together with Washington and maintain respectful communications.
"After this first meeting we agreed on: 1. The willingness of both governments to work together to gain trust and improve relations. 2. Maintain communications in a respectful and constructive manner," the representatives, Jorge Rodriguez and Hector Rodriguez, posted on social media site X.
Their message followed an online meeting between the two sides, in which Venezuela said that "to continue recovering mutual trust and relations between the governments, the principles of self-determination, sovereignty and reciprocity must be respected."
On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the start of direct dialogues between Caracas and Washington, and the appointment of the president of parliament, Jorge Rodriguez, and the governor of central Miranda state, Hector Rodriguez, as government representatives.
"I have accepted the proposal of the United States government to resume direct dialogues; they will resume next Wednesday," he said.
"We are going to debate, to look for new agreements so that what was signed in Qatar is fulfilled. I want dialogue, I want understanding, I want a future for our relations, I want changes," Maduro said. â–

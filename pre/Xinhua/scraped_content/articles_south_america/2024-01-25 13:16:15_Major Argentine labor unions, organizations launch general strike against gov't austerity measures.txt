BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's main labor unions, social organizations and progressive groups launched a 12-hour strike Wednesday noon to protest austerity measures proposed by President Javier Milei's government.
The strike, which included a march to Congress in the capital city of Buenos Aires, was organized by the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), among other workers' groups.
The largest union-led protest in Argentina within four years was aimed at deterring the government from implementing a slew of belt-tightening measures and reforms to deregulate the economy.
Presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni called the strike "absolute nonsense."
Milei admits the proposed reforms are painful, but says they are necessary to rehabilitate the country's troubled economy.
Labor leader Eduardo Belliboni told reporters the strike aimed to "defend people's rights."
The Argentine government mounted an operation to station troops, backed by fire trucks, assault vehicles and motorcycles at major intersections around the capital.
As part of the proposed reforms, the government wants to make major cuts to public spending and privatize state-owned companies through an executive order called the Decree of Necessity and Urgency, as well as a bill currently being debated by the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. â–

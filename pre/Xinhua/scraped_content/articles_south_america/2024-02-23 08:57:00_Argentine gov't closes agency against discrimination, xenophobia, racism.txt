BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government on Thursday announced it was closing the agency in charge of fighting discrimination, xenophobia and racism, saying such agencies served "no purpose."
The president's office had started the process of closing down the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI), presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a press conference.
The measure was a campaign promise of President Javier Milei and part of a comprehensive policy of "dismantling different institutes" that do not generate a benefit for Argentines, said Adorni.
"We are taking the first steps towards dismantling different institutes that are useless or are large political boxes or are simply places to generate militant employment," he said.
"There are countless institutes that President Milei is determined to close or dismantle ... our priority was to shrink the government" to reduce public spending and lower taxes, he said.
INADI, created in 1995, said on its website that it works "to combat all forms of discrimination, xenophobia and racism, promoting federal and transversal public policies in coordination with civil society to achieve a diverse and egalitarian society." â–

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has surpassed a record 5 million cases of dengue so far this year, with nearly 3,000 confirmed deaths from the disease, the Ministry of Health said Tuesday.
According to the most recent data, 5,145,295 probable cases of dengue have been registered in the country, causing 2,899 confirmed deaths.
This year, Brazil is experiencing the largest dengue outbreak in its history, and the outbreak is spreading to some neighboring countries.
According to the ministry, the surge in cases this year is related to factors such as climate change and the circulation of multiple serotypes of dengue virus. â–

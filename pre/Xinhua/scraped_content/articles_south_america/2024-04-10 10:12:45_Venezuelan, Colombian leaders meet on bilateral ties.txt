CARACAS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday met with his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro here to discuss bilateral relations.
"Nothing and no one will separate us from Colombia ... We have great goals to achieve: making progress in economy, in trade and in peace," the Venezuelan president said on social media platform X.
The two nations have "many things to deepen: energy projects, gas, oil, border security, among other issues and common points that are above our differences," he added.
Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil received the Colombian president at the Simon Bolivar International Airport.
Gil posted on X, "we welcome Colombian President Gustavo Petro back to our country, with whom we have an important common agenda for the good of our peoples and the region. Fraternity and peaceful diplomacy continue to triumph."
Venezuela severed political and diplomatic ties with Colombia on Feb. 23, 2019, after the neighboring nation, under U.S. pressure, recognized Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president instead of the mandate of President Maduro.
The two countries resumed diplomatic relations in August 2022. â–

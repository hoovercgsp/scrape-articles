CARACAS, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of a Latin American bloc expressed Sunday their solidarity with Mexico and rejection of what they described as "slander and interference" from the United States.
Accusations out of Washington that Mexico's government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, collaborates with drug cartels are "unfounded," the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) said in a statement.
"They are trying to criminalize Mexico, while ignoring the historical responsibility of the U.S. government in the crisis of violence and drug trafficking that affects our region," the Caracas, Venezuela-based bloc said.
"The United States is the main supplier of high-powered weapons to criminal groups, which, coupled with its negligent health policies and the irresponsibility of pharmaceutical corporations, continues to claim thousands of lives every year," the bloc added.
It expressed its support for the Mexican government's efforts to combat organized crime, as well as its "commitment to security and justice."
"Unilateral impositions and actions that violate the principles of international law are unacceptable," it said.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed the Mexican government has ties to criminal organizations, a claim rejected by Sheinbaum, who highlighted the Mexican government's efforts to combat drug trafficking and other crimes. â–

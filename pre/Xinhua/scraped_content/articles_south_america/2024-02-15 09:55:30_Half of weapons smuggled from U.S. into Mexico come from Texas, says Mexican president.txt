MEXICO CITY, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- "Half of all the weapons that enter Mexico from the United States come from Texas," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday.
Speaking during his usual daily press conference, Lopez Obrador questioned why Texas' Governor Greg Abbott allows this situation to continue given that he is one of the main proponents of tighter border controls.
According to the president, since the start of his administration in December 2018, almost 50,000 weapons have been seized, 70 percent of which originated in the United States and half of that percentage in Texas.
"How does the governor of Texas respond to this?" Lopez Obrador asked reporters at the National Palace in Mexico City.
Mexico has repeatedly called on the United States to do more to control the flow of firearms into Mexico, which fuels violence, especially between rival criminal organizations.
Last week, the Mexican government asked the United States and Canada to help combat the trafficking of "high-powered" weapons. â–

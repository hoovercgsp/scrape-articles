BRASILIA, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva signed a decree on Tuesday establishing the National Cybersecurity Policy (PNCiber) to promote national security related to cyber or virtual reality.
According to the decree published in the Official Gazette, the National Cybersecurity Committee (CNCiber) holds the responsibility of proposing updates to both the PNCiber and its mechanisms, including the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the National Cybersecurity Plan.
CNCiber will also be in charge of suggesting collaboration strategies for international technical cooperation on cybercrime.
"The PNCiber is a proposal aimed at unifying the existing regulatory mosaic, minimizing the growing number of incidents that affect the country, which cause huge losses for Brazilian society," the decree said.
The policy will include the adoption of regulatory measures and oversight mechanisms to promote cybersecurity in the country, as well as the development of national products, services and technologies oriented toward cybersecurity.
Another objective of the policy is to promote action in cyberspace, especially in relation to children and adolescents, in addition to propping up cybersecurity technical and professional training in the country. â–

QUITO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and one was injured on Tuesday when their small plane crashed in Santa Rosa, Ecuador's southern coastal province of El Oro, the General Directorate for Civil Aviation said.
The Piper-34 light aircraft was flying from the southwest coastal city of Guayaquil towards Santa Rosa, the agency said in a statement.
Pilot David Parreno and a passenger, Augusto Viera, died in the accident, while the second passenger, Adrian Yumbala, was injured and taken to a health center for treatment.
Personnel from the Accident Investigative Board went to the scene of the accident to investigate, the statement said.
According to media reports, local residents said the plane fell in a wooded area on a hill, and rescue teams said remains of the aircraft were burnt.
This is the fourth aircraft accident in the South American country in the last two months.
On April 26, a military helicopter crashed in the northeast province of Pastaza, leaving eight dead, and on May 6, a Navy helicopter crashed in the western coastal province of Santa Elena, killing two pilots.
Three days later, a Cessna aircraft suffered an incident during takeoff on a runway in Morona Santiago, but there were no victims. â–

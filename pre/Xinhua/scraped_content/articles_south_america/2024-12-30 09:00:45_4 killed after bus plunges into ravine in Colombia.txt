BOGOTA, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- A bus plunged into a ravine in Colombia on Sunday, killing at least four people, including an underage girl, and injuring seven others, local authorities reported.
The accident occurred on the Azauncha-Bogota road in the municipality of Caparrapi, Cundinamarca, in central Colombia. Emergency responders from the National Police and the Caparrapi Fire Department were dispatched to the scene.
While the exact cause of the accident remains unclear, preliminary findings suggest the driver lost control of the vehicle due to heavy rain and poor road conditions. â–

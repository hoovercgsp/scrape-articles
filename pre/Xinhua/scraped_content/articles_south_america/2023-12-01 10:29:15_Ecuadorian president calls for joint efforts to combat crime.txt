QUITO, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who took office last week, swore in new chiefs of the armed forces on Thursday and called on them to work closely with the government in the "war" against rampant crime.
"I appeal to you ... to fight for Ecuador, to work together with this government for a country that is seriously wounded and submerged in violence, where inequalities have become a totally negative constant," Noboa said during the swearing-in ceremony at the Carondelet Palace in Quito.
The president renewed the military leadership this week by decree, appointing a new head of the Armed Forces Joint Command, as well as new commanders of the army, air force and navy. â–

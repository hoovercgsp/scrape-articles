LIMA, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- At least five people, including three children, lost their lives in a large fire that broke out Monday night in a community in the southern Peruvian region of Arequipa, local authorities said Tuesday.
The fire started around 11:00 p.m. local time Monday (0400 GMT Tuesday) in the Carlos Portocarrero Dongo settlement in Secocha, Camana province. It was brought under control by early Tuesday morning, leaving at least 10 homes damaged and over 100 people homeless.
Jose Barrezueta, head of the Regional Emergency Operations Center of Arequipa, told the private broadcaster Radio Programas del Peru that five fatalities had been confirmed so far.
"Another person injured in the fire is being treated at a local hospital," according to the National Emergency Operations Center.
According to La Republica newspaper, initial investigations indicate the fire was caused by a short circuit in a prefabricated house, triggering the explosion of domestic gas tanks, which intensified the blaze.
"The flames spread rapidly, consuming multiple homes and leaving families with no time to react," the outlet reported. â–

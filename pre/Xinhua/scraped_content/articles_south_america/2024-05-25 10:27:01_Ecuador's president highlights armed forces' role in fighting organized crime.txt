QUITO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on Friday stressed the role of the armed forces in fighting organized crime and drug trafficking gangs.
Noboa made the comments as he presided over a ceremony marking the Battle of Pichincha of May 24, 1822, in which Ecuador won its independence from Spain.
"During the internal conflict against terrorist groups, once again our soldiers are an example of courage and sacrifice. Putting their own lives at risk, they confront dangerous criminals on the streets, in the squares, and in prisons with only one objective: to return freedom and peace to Ecuador," the president said.
Since Noboa declared the "internal armed conflict" on Jan. 9, the military has been deployed to eliminate 22 criminal gangs designated as "terrorists."
"The union and support to defeat terrorism is tilting the balance and today we can say that the results are bearing fruit," the president said. â–

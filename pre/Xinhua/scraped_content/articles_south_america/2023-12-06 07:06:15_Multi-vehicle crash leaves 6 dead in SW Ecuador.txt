QUITO, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- A multi-vehicle collision in southwest Ecuador has left six people dead and 11 injured, local media said Tuesday, citing reports from the national emergency service, ECU 911.
The accident, which occurred along state highway 487 in El Triunfo canton in Guayas province, involved an interprovincial bus, a dump truck and a trailer, the Ecuadorian Transit Commission posted on social media.
ECU 911 was alerted of the accident at 06:51 a.m. local time (11:51 GMT), and teams from the Ecuadorian Transit Commission, National Police, Public Health Ministry and El Triunfo Fire Department were dispatched to the scene.
The injured were treated on site and later transferred by ambulance to a local hospital, ECU 911 added.
Authorities have not reported the causes of the tragedy, but wet and slippery road surfaces may have played a role, videos posted on social media suggest.
Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in Ecuador, mainly due to inexperienced drivers and speeding, according to local authorities. â–

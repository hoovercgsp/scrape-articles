CARACAS, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela received its ninth cultural inscription in the World Heritage lists of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Venezuelan Minister of Culture Ernesto Villegas announced Wednesday.
The program for the safeguarding of the Bandos and Parrandas of the Holy Innocents of Caucagua was selected for the UNESCO Register of Good Safeguarding Practices of the Intangible Cultural Heritage during the 18th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage taking place in Botswana on Dec. 4-9.

LIMA, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on Tuesday appointed Victor Torres Falcon as interior minister, replacing Vicente Romero Fernandez, who resigned last week after being censured by Congress.
Torres Falcon is a retired national police general, and held different positions such as head of the Special Unified Command of Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley.
Noting that the new minister has "a difficult task" ahead, Boluarte said she is certain he will know "how to respond to the level that the citizenry and all of Peru demands."
His predecessor Romero was censured by Congress on Nov. 15 for alleged "incapacity and lack of leadership to fight crime."
Criticism against Romero was fueled by the lack of results of a state of emergency declared by the government in September to tackle crime in four districts of the Lima metropolitan area and seven in the northern department of Piura. â–

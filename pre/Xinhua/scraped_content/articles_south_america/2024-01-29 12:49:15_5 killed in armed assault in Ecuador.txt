QUITO, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed and seven others injured in an armed assault in the Vinces canton, in Ecuador's coastal Los Rios province, local media reported on Sunday.
The attack occurred on Saturday evening outside a home where a group of young people had gathered for a party, local daily El Universo reported, adding that armed assailants arrived in two trucks and began shooting at everyone present.
Some of those attending the party managed to save their lives after running and getting to safety, while others could not escape the massacre, it said.
The incident comes a week following the country's largest drug seizure.
The South American country has intensified its fight against violence and drug trafficking since the government declared the existence of an "internal armed conflict" with criminal groups. â–

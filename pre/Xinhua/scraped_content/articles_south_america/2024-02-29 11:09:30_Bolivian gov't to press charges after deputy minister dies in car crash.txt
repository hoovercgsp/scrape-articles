LA PAZ, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia's government plans to pursue firm legal action after the deputy transportation minister, Israel Ticona, died in a traffic accident caused by a road blockade in the country's eastern department of Santa Cruz, said Bolivian Minister of Government Eduardo del Castillo Wednesday.
The accident occurred on Tuesday night when he was traveling to the town of Cuatro Canadas to resolve the blockade. The van he was traveling in collided with a truck stopped by the roadblock. Following the accident, those behind the blockade suspended their protest.
Del Castillo said the organizers of the anti-government blockade were responsible, particularly Armando Apaza, the leader of the transporters, for putting public safety at risk, he said.
Bolivian President Luis Arce expressed his condolences to Ticona's family and relatives.
The charges announced by the government include conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of public function, sabotage and manslaughter. â–

GENEVA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of the Global Trade Helpdesk is now available, providing essential trade data to help small businesses navigate international markets, developers said Thursday.
Developed by the Geneva-headquartered International Trade Centre (ITC) and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), the Chinese version of the platform integrates information from 11 partner agencies.
It provides data on imports, market dynamics, tariffs, regulatory requirements, and insights into trade finance, e-commerce marketplaces, and digital payment systems.
The platform helps Chinese businesses navigate global trade complexities and seize international market opportunities. Small businesses, typically holding a modest export share, can now make informed decisions and expand their global presence.
The platform also offers targeted training programs and monthly sessions across China to support businesses in entering and competing in new markets.
"We have been delivering on our original mandate of making trade information more accessible to small businesses globally for six decades. We're now building on that work to support small businesses in China," said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of ITC, which operates as a joint agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations (UN).
The Global Trade Helpdesk, available in eight languages, including Chinese, has so far attracted over 250,000 users from over 190 economies. â–

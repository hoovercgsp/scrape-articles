BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese industry body on Friday called on the European Union (EU) to be objective, fair and transparent in its ongoing probe into Chinese battery electric vehicles and to avoid adopting any protectionist measures.
The European Commission initiated an anti-subsidy investigation into the imports of battery electric vehicles from China and is set to determine whether punitive tariffs should be imposed to protect EU manufacturers from Chinese competitors.
Shi Yonghong, vice president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME), expressed concerns about bias in the Commission's investigations, noting that "the findings are very likely to be distorted and unobjective."
CCCME was authorized by 12 Chinese electric vehicle exporting producers in the case, including three sampled exporting producers that are being individually investigated by the Commission. â–

MOSCOW, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between Russia and China is essential to maintaining global stability at a time of rising tensions around the world, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday in his annual press conference.
He noted that the Russia-China partnership is one of the main stabilizing factors in modern international relations.
Lavrov said Washington and its allies from the North Atlantic Alliance are attempting to heighten global confrontations and hostilities, sowing discord and creating divisions across Europe and elsewhere.
The foreign minister noted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is currently deepening ties with the Eurasian Economic Union, which aligns with the Belt and Road initiative.
"The international significance of our cooperation, partnership and our future plans is immense, and I am convinced that these plans will be realized," Lavrov said. â–

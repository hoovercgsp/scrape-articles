ZAGUBICA, Serbia, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- A wildfire, which ignited on August 25 in the mountains 165 kilometers southeast of Belgrade, put Zagubica's 9,000 residents to the test, as the flames rapidly spread, endangering their homes and livelihoods.
In this critical moment, the Black Peak 150MW wind power project office, operated by China DC Technical Import & Export Corporation's Belgrade Branch, responded promptly to the call for help.
Though the fire posed no immediate danger to the wind farm, the Chinese company acted swiftly. They dispatched equipment and personnel to work alongside local respondents, including the Serbian Ministry of Interior and fire crews, to stop the fire's advance just kilometers from the villages of Zagubica and Suvi Do.
The community of Zagubica in eastern Serbia expressed its gratitude to the Chinese operators of the wind farm for their critical support during the devastating mountain wildfire that swept through the area in late August.
"In a time of crisis, the support you provided wasn't just technical; it was a powerful symbol of solidarity and unity, reminding us that together, we can overcome any challenge," the letter sent by the mayor's office expressed.
This expression of gratitude highlights the strengthening bond between the local Serbian community and their Chinese partners, whose timely intervention played a crucial role in preventing a potential catastrophe.
For Mayor Safet Pavlovic, the decision to seek help from Chinese partners was immediate. Within hours, they sent a bulldozer and operator, who "worked tirelessly across the rugged terrain for five days, helping us contain the fire," Pavlovic recalled.
Nenad Milosavljevic, head of a local utility company, emphasized the scale of the blaze, describing it as the largest the region had ever faced. He vividly recalled the critical moments when Chinese rescue personnel were the first to arrive on the scene.
"As soon as they arrived, we began working. We didn't stop until we had secured the area, ensuring the fire couldn't reach Zagubica," said Milosavljevic with relief.
The fire was fully extinguished by August 30, thanks to the combined efforts of local and Chinese forces. "We managed to stop the fire just 3 or 4 kilometers from the village," Milosavljevic reflected. "If we hadn't, the flames would have engulfed the settlement, causing unimaginable damage and potentially loss of life."
Mayor Pavlovic praised the swift and decisive actions of the Chinese companies. "Their response made all the difference. We were able to save our villages and farmland. It could have been a disaster," he told Xinhua.
Zhang Kun, Project Manager of Serbia Black Peak 150MW Wind Power EPC Project at China DC Technical Import and Export Corporation of Genertec International, humbly acknowledged the recognition.
"Our contribution felt small, but the gratitude from the local government was deeply touching. We're honored to have played a part in protecting this community," Zhang said.
"This mutual support only strengthens the bond between our nations. The recognition from the local government reaffirms our commitment, not just in emergencies, but for the long-term development of Zagubica," Zhang added.
The devastating wildfire highlighted the power of international cooperation in times of crisis. As Zagubica looks to the future, the partnership with Chinese companies, solidified during this moment of need, is expected to deepen further.
"We have excellent cooperation with representatives of Chinese companies. They've already expressed their willingness to assist with our infrastructure, education, and healthcare," Pavlovic shared, expressing optimism about the future.
Both local leaders and their Chinese partners view the event as providing a foundation for even stronger collaboration. With the ongoing development of the wind park and other projects, the relationship between Zagubica and its Chinese allies promises to flourish in the years to come.
"As we continue our work here ... I believe our friendship and cooperation will only grow stronger," Zhang said. â–

VIENNA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- A documentary about Ferdinand Adler, a Jewish violinist who fled to Shanghai from the Nazis in 1939, and his story with one of his Chinese music students was screened in Vienna Friday night.
The film "Visit from China" by Austrian director Paul Rosdy tells the story of Adler and Sheng Mingliang, who was among a group of Chinese young students who learned to play the violin free of charge from Adler when the musician took refuge in China.
The film is narrated through the eyes of their children and sheds light on the lives of Jewish refugees in China during World War II (WWII).
Christina Adler, daughter of Ferdinand Adler, said at the screening that the movie was an honor for her father and his stories with his Chinese students.
An exhibition on Adler's life in Shanghai will run in the cinema Metro Kinokulturhaus until Nov. 24.

AMSTERDAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chris Jan Reitsma, the owner of Dutch DMQ Trading Company, is preparing to attend the seventh China International Import Expo (CIIE) scheduled for November in Shanghai.
Calling the expo a highly esteemed and globally diverse exhibition, Reitsma shared his company's experience of and benefits from being a CIIE exhibitor during the past five consecutive years.
"It's a very international exhibition and also a high-standard exhibition. I like it a lot," Reitsma said via a video link at a promotion event for the expo earlier this week.
Reitsma's company distributes milk power under the brand "Two Cows" in China. In 2019, it became a CIIE exhibitor.
At the promotional event, Reitsma highlighted the expo's focus on attracting high-quality buyers and professional visitors.
Last year, Reitsma's company shared a booth with the other dairy companies in the CIIE's food hall. "We received a lot of customers and quite a lot of potential (B2B) buyers for our product," Reitsma said.
The company showcased its products alongside renowned companies like Philips, which exhibited their medical equipment, he recalled. "So we were in the same line as those big companies. And that made me very proud."
He said his company is ready to participate in the upcoming years and explore new methods, such as online streaming. â–

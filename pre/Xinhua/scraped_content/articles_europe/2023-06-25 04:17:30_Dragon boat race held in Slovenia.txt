LJUBLJANA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A dragon boat race was held in the Ljubljanica River in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana on Saturday to mark the Chinese traditional Dragon Boat Festival.
Hundreds of people attended the event, which was organized by the Confucius Institute at the University of Ljubljana. The institute has been organizing the annual dragon boat race in Slovenia for over 20 years.
"Dragon Boat Festival is one of the most important festivals in China and has a tradition of over 2000 years. It is a good event for Chinese people who live here but also for local people who can experience the traditional culture of China in this way," said Chinese Ambassador to Slovenia Wang Shunqing.
Fourteen dragon boats competed in a 200-meter race. The team of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce won first place.
"It was a lot of fun although rowing was harder than it looks because it was difficult to catch the fast rhythm of other rowers in our boat. I will certainly try to come again next year," said Ursa, a student from Ljubljana.
People who attended the event could also try to write down their names in Chinese characters and chose between numerous traditional Chinese meals.
"I like competing and have attended this race already last year but what I like most about it is the Chinese food which is very good," said Colin from the seaside city of Koper in western Slovenia.
Jakob Marusic from the Kayak Association of Slovenia helped the Confucius Institute in organizing the event. He told Xinhua that all the boats used at the event were made in China. â–

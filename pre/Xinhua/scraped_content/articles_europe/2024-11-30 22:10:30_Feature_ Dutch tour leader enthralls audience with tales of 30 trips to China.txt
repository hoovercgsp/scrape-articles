THE HAGUE, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- With over 30 visits to China and experience guiding over 450 tourists, Tom Lops, a seasoned tour leader, shared his captivating anecdotes and practical advice to Dutch audience during an event on Friday at The Hague's China Cultural Center.
The China journey of Lops, a tour leader with TUI, one of Europe's leading travel and tourism companies, began with a serendipitous newspaper advertisement.
In 2008, he embarked on his first trip to China, visiting iconic cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Guangzhou.
"It was a roller coaster of new impressions, the people, the country, and the things that I saw," Lops recalled.
That initial visit sparked a deep curiosity, leading him to explore remote regions and immerse himself in diverse cultures across the country.
Highlights of his travels include a heartfelt moment in Guizhou, where he photographed local villagers in 2010 and reunited them with their own photographs two years later.
A journey along the Silk Road in Gansu Province revealed a completely different side of China. The region's Buddhist culture, ancient statues, and vast deserts offered a unique and unforgettable experience unlike anything he had encountered before.
Thereafter, Lops returned year after year, witnessing the significant changes in China's tourism landscape. "Traveling in China has become much more tourist-friendly," citing digital payments, bike-sharing, and extended visa policies.
With the advent of digital payment apps, bike-sharing services, and an improved visa policy, navigating both cities and rural areas has become seamless for foreign travelers, he said.
"I think it's very convenient to rent a bike in China. You can pick it up and drop it off almost anywhere. It's ideal for exploring city centers," he said.
He also praised the recent extension of China's visa policy from 15 to 30 days, emphasizing how it enables visitors to balance time between bustling cities and tranquil countryside.
Lops believes that first-time visitors to China will be struck by the friendliness of its people. "They are always curious to know where you come from and like to have a chat with you," he said.
Lops takes pride in his role as a cultural bridge. "I really like to be an intermediary between the Dutch people and the Chinese people. I've already made a lot of friends," he said. Over the years, he has built connections with more than 400 friends on WeChat from across China.
Looking ahead, Lops hopes to explore China's famed mountains, including Mount Huashan in Shaanxi Province and Mount Huangshan in Anhui Province.
For those planning their first trip to China, Lops said there's no need for extensive preparations. "You will be surprised by all the new impressions that you will have in this country. You will be amazed," he noted. â–

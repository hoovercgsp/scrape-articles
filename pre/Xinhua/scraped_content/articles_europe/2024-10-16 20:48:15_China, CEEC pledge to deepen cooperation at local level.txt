JINAN, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) on Wednesday expressed their willingness to deepen cooperation at the local level to promote steady and long-term cooperation between China and CEEC.
Li Hongzhong, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, addressed the opening ceremony of the 6th Local Leaders' Meeting of China and CEEC held in Yantai, east China's Shandong Province.

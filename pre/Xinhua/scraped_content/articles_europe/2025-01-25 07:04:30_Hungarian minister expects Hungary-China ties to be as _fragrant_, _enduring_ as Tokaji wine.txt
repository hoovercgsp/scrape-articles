BUDAPEST, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Culture and Innovation Minister Balazs Hanko on Friday expressed his hopes for Hungary-China relations to be as "fragrant" and "enduring" as Hungarian Tokaji wine.

"For the Year of the Snake, I wish everyone happiness, success, and good health," Hanko told Xinhua at the event, which celebrated the Spring Festival, one of China's most cherished traditional holidays. The gathering underscored the growing partnership between Hungary and China.
Reflecting on the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2024, Hanko called the past year a milestone in bilateral relations.

In 2025, we aim to expand these efforts with more exhibitions, joint concerts, and initiatives to further deepen our exceptional relationship," he said.
Highlighting the stronger cultural ties between the two countries, Hanko cited the mutual establishment of cultural centers in Budapest and Beijing, noting that they have served as vital platforms for showcasing heritage and encouraging exchange.
Chinese Ambassador to Hungary Gong Tao described 2024 as a "golden voyage" in China-Hungary relations, citing deepened political trust and tangible progress in economic, cultural, tourism, and educational cooperation.

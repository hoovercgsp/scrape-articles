LONDON, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Emerging Chinese designer Zhong Zixin on Tuesday wowed audiences as she unveiled her Spring/Summer 2025 collection in a highly-anticipated fashion show in central London.
As the inaugural winner of the VOGUE China Fashion Fund, Chinese Designer Prize, Zhong has consistently drawn inspiration from her family and heritage, blending Eastern aesthetics with modern fashion perspectives. Her brand, Zhong Zixin, has garnered acclaim from leading fashion authorities.
Following her international debut in Paris last year, Zhong, sponsored by VOGUE China, once again showcased the creativity of China's new generation of young designers to the international fashion arena.
Zhong told Xinhua that her latest collection draws inspiration from the famous painting Bacchus by Italian artist Caravaggio. The work's atmosphere evoked memories of Zhong's childhood -- grapevines climbing trellises filling her home with the fragrance of fresh fruit.
Zhong's collection features goblets under Bacchus' domain being transformed into flowing silhouettes, while grapes and vines intertwine to create rich textures. Contrasting shades and sizes of mosaic pieces are reassembled, resulting in a timeless visual effect.
Oliver Rapport, director of Rapport London, a British brand, said he was very impressed by the show. Emerging Chinese designers offer a fresh perspective for the fashion industry, and there is also "growing appetite in the West for viewing Chinese designers' collections," he said. â–

GROZNY, Russia, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's North Caucasus region is interested in developing cooperation with China and is seeking opportunities to attract Chinese partners, Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Nazarov said Monday.
"We need to make it interesting for the Chinese side to be here. Therefore, in this regard, we are now trying to find common ground. When it is interesting for both sides, then we can talk about success," Nazarov told Xinhua on the sidelines of the Caucasus Investment Forum.
The forum is being held in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, from Monday to Wednesday.
Speaking about the potential of the North Caucasus region, the deputy minister highlighted natural resources, a growing market, and high-tech areas that can be developed jointly with Chinese partners.
He noted that projects in the automotive industry and the localization of production on ready-made sites have already been discussed with several Chinese companies.
"In the automotive industry, we considered projects not for assembling cars but for localizing specific components... We are ready. Therefore, I think we will find common ground in this direction," added Nazarov. â–

BERLIN, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- China remained Germany's most important trading partner for the eighth year in a row in 2023, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said on Wednesday.
China continued to be "by far the most important supplier country for Germany, as it has been since 2015," Destatis noted.
Telecommunications equipment, processing machines, and other electronic devices as well as cars were Germany's most imported goods from China in terms of value, according to the figures.
Germany continues to grow economic ties with China. Direct investments made in the country rose by more than 4 percent to a record 11.9 billion euros (12.8 billion U.S. dollars), according to calculations published on Wednesday by the German Economic Institute (IW).
In the last three years alone, German companies invested as much in China as they had from 2015 to 2020, according to the IW. (1 euro = 1.07 U.S. dollar) â–

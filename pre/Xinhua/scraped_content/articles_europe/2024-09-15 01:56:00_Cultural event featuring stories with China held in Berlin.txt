BERLIN, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- A cultural event titled "Written in the Sky: My China Story" was held in Berlin on Saturday to celebrate the upcoming 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Officials from the Chinese Embassy in Germany, the Center for Language Education and Cooperation under China's Ministry of Education, and the Association of German China Societies participated in the event. Teachers and students from the German Burg Chinese Chorus, and various schools and universities were also among the nearly 200 attendees.
At the event, the German Burg Chinese Chorus performed several classic songs, including "To the Cloud" and "Jasmine Flower," in both Chinese and German.
All attendees also watched a special video message sent by the astronauts of Shenzhou-18 from the space station.
In his speech, Chinese Ambassador to Germany Deng Hongbo emphasized that both China and Germany share a profound cultural heritage, and mutual appreciation, attraction, and learning have never ceased. He also highlighted that in an era of both opportunities and challenges, the world needs more exchange and cooperation than ever before.
Ivan Pavlovic, one of the chorus members, is pursuing a degree in Modern East Asian Studies with a focus on the Chinese economy at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
"My story with China is more than an academic connection. The bond (with China) has shaped my life in many ways and continues to challenge and enrich me in new and unexpected ways," he said.
The "Written in the Sky: My China Story" event will also be held at the United Nations headquarters and in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. â–

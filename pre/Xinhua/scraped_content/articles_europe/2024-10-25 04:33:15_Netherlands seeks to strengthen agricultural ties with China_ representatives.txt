WASSENAAR, the Netherlands, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands is looking to deepen its agricultural partnership with China, building on a long history of collaboration in the sector, according to Dutch representatives at a Sino-Dutch seminar on agricultural cooperation held here on Wednesday.
Officials, entrepreneurs and researchers from China's Shanghai and the Netherlands' South Holland province met here on Wednesday to exchange ideas and explore opportunities for cooperation in agricultural technology innovation and sustainable development.
In a video message, Erik Smidt, agricultural counselor at the Dutch Embassy in China, emphasized the enduring ties between the two nations.
"China and the Netherlands share a rich history of cooperation in agriculture, with collaboration spanning decades," said Smidt. "We have worked together on various projects ranging from high-tech agriculture to food safety and sustainability."
Smidt highlighted several successful joint ventures involving Dutch and Chinese companies, universities, and research institutions in fields such as horticulture and dairy.
These partnerships, he noted, showcase "best practices in agricultural production that benefit both our countries."
According to Smidt, these collaborations have also promoted the exchange of expertise, driving advancements in precision agriculture, resource management, and sustainability.
Floriske Deutman, board member of the Tomato World Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting Dutch agricultural products, emphasized the synergy between Dutch technology and the Chinese market.
"The greatest potential for collaboration between the Netherlands and China, especially in Shanghai, lies in the synergy of advanced Dutch agricultural technology with China's vast and dynamic market," Deutman told Xinhua in an interview.
"Together, we can focus on integrating smart greenhouse technology, precision farming, and data-driven agriculture into Shanghai's agri-horticultural sector," she added. â–

ROME, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition featuring China's agricultural and rural development in recent years was held late Friday in Rome.
Hosted by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the exhibition illustrated the latest changes and progress in China's agricultural and rural areas with abundant photos covering major themes such as poverty eradication, rural revitalization, digital farming, South-South and triangular cooperation, and globally important agricultural heritage systems.
Speaking at Friday's reception at the Permanent Representation of China to United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, Chinese Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian noted that the Chinese government has provided considerable agricultural technical assistance to developing countries, particularly to the least developed countries.
China has donated 130 million U.S. dollars to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) since 2009, exclusively for South-South and triangular cooperation, Tang said.
More than 300 Chinese specialists in host countries have shared agricultural technology and poverty eradication experience to local people, he added.
The event gathered more than 200 attendees, including leaders from UN agencies such as FAO, World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, as well as agricultural ministers and representatives from over 100 countries. â–

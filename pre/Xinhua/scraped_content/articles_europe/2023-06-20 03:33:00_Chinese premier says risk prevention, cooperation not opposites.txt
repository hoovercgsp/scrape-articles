BERLIN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Monday that risk prevention and cooperation are not opposites.
Enterprises should be re-put in the driving seat in terms of risk prevention, Li said while attending a seminar with representatives of the German business community.
Noting that it is understandable that all parties have their own security concerns, Li said that what is important is how to reasonably define and guard against risks.
If not handled properly and the risks are amplified, more and bigger problems will only be created, he said, adding that enterprises have the most direct and acute sense of risk and know how to avoid and respond to it.
Failure to cooperate is the biggest risk, and failure to develop is the biggest insecurity, he noted.
With economic globalization, the world economy has become interconnected, which entails a dialectical view of dependence, Li said.
That means refraining from exaggerating the degree of dependence or even simply equating interdependence with insecurity, he added.
As for some specific problems, Li urged all parties to analyze them in detail, and jointly prevent and respond to them through consultation and cooperation. â–

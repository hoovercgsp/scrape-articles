LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Britain on Tuesday urged relevant British politicians to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.
Responding to a question concerning the accusations made on social media on Monday by Britain's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and other British politicians against the Hong Kong SAR police for issuing arrest warrants for eight anti-China, destabilizing persons who have fled overseas, the spokesperson urged relevant British politicians to stop using these anti-China disruptors to jeopardize China's sovereignty and security.
"The determination of the Chinese people to oppose foreign interference and safeguard our interests is rock-firm and unshakable," the spokesperson said.
The British politicians spoke publicly for the wanted persons, grossly interfering in Hong Kong's rule of law and China's internal affairs, the spokesperson said. "China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this."
The wanted persons are a small group of anti-China forces bent on destabilizing Hong Kong, the spokesperson said, noting after stoking the disturbance over proposed legislative amendments in Hong Kong, they fled overseas, but continue to incite secession and engage in activities that aim to disrupt Hong Kong, causing huge public outrage.
The Hong Kong SAR government has issued the arrest warrants in accordance with the national security law and relevant local laws, the spokesperson said.
"This is constitutional and legal, and conforms to people's will. It is a just move to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and a necessary action to safeguard China's national sovereignty and security," the spokesperson added. â–

BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies are injecting vitality into global scientific and technological innovation, ZTE's chief development officer Cui Li said here in an interview with Xinhua during the Mobile World Congress (MWC).
This year's MWC has drawn over 300 Chinese companies across the information and communication technology ecosystem, contributing to global digital development, Cui said.
At the MWC, ZTE presented its end-to-end innovation, including zero-carbon site solutions in Europe, a new generation world's-first 5G+AI 3D tablet Nubia Pad 3D II, as well as the brand's 5G-Advanced solution.
"I believe that this robust development momentum [from Chinese companies] will not only promote the upgrade and transformation of China's industries, but also inject vitality into global scientific and technological innovation," Cui said.
She stressed that companies need more cooperation and win-win results, rather than simply focusing on themselves.
"We have always believed that cooperation makes us strong, and isolation makes us weak," said Cui.
ZTE has cooperated with many operators around the world to establish joint innovation centers to accelerate the local application of innovation results, according to Cui.
"International exchanges and cooperation can promote cultural diversity and mutual understanding, enhance trust, and contribute to global harmony," she said, adding that companies should therefore embrace extensive cooperation, and openness. â–

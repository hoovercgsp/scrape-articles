BERLIN, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- China is developing at an incredible pace, making it a crucial sales market and driver of innovation, said Rudolf Kloetscher, member of the management board of Europe's leading home appliance manufacturer BSH Home Appliances Group.
Kloetscher, BSH's chief sales & service officer, made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Saturday.
He said: "There is no doubt that China, with its 1.4 billion people, represents a massive consumer market. However, its value extends far beyond that. The innovations developed for Chinese consumers are increasingly influencing our markets outside China, which gives us a great advantage in other global markets where we operate."
Known for brands such as Siemens and Bosch, BSH has been operating on the Chinese market for 30 years.
"For three decades, we have served the Chinese market, and we are really proud to have remained strong throughout this extensive period. We are equally proud to have had the opportunity to serve Chinese consumers for so many years," Kloetscher said.
He also highlighted that in order to support the continued growth of its business in China, BSH has invested heavily in establishing manufacturing plants and R&D centers within the country. "We have a dedicated team of engineers focused on developing products specifically for the Chinese market," he said.
"To achieve more innovative ideas, we have promoted important collaborations with universities in China, and this is something we are increasingly focused on. China provides us with significant stimulation in terms of innovation and speed. We are constantly seeking new ways and products to make our consumers' lives easier."
Kloetscher added: "I'm deeply convinced of China's potential. Despite a couple of hiccups during the three decades of our business, we have achieved significant growth in China. Looking ahead, we are confident that we will continue to develop and thrive in this market in the coming years."
Concerning the growing presence of Chinese brands on the European market, Kloetscher said he welcomed both fair competition and collaboration.
"I've been in the home appliance industry for over 30 years, and without the evolution of competition, I wouldn't have stayed this long. I welcome all competitors, big or small," he said. "Competition shows how attractive our industry is. The more competition there is, the more innovative ideas and solutions emerge, pushing all of us to a higher level."
BSH has already established cooperative relationships with Chinese companies in both directions, Kloetscher said.
"Collaborations can help bridge gaps in expertise or timing. Sometimes, one company possesses specific knowledge or know-how that the other lacks or would take time to develop independently. By working together, both sides can address immediate consumer needs more efficiently. These partnerships are mutually beneficial, allowing both companies to learn from each other and quickly adapt to market demands," he added. â–

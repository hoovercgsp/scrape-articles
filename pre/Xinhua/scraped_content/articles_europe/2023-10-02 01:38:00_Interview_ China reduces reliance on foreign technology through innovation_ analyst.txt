AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior analyst of an international media technology association has expressed optimism about China's burgeoning digital technology sector, emphasizing the country's commitment to reducing its reliance on foreign technology through innovation.
Anna-Claire Bernardes, senior analyst of the International Trade Association for the Broadcast & Media Industry (IABM), told Xinhua in a recent interview that China has been placing a significant emphasis on developing its digital economy while actively supporting the development and application of technologies such as cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence.
This robust growth in China's digital technology sector is poised to reshape the future job market while simultaneously reducing China's dependence on foreign technologies, she said.
"It means the development of digital technology assets are going to transform, bit by bit, the jobs and skill sets and build really a strong digital native mindset," said the analyst.
According to Bernardes, some major Chinese tech companies have the capacity to provide digital services on their own terms.
"They've got the internal and national skills to do so, and less reliance on foreign countries means that tech is becoming more accessible and cheaper as well," she said.
Citing an analysis report from the IABM, she said that even though there has been a decrease in external demand for goods, services, and technology from Europe and the United States, Asia "remains a dynamic region compared to a challenging world economy."
China is serving as a critical driver of economic growth not only in Asia but on a global scale, she added.
The IABM is an independent international trade organization with over 500 members worldwide, covering the entire broadcast and media technology supply chain. â–

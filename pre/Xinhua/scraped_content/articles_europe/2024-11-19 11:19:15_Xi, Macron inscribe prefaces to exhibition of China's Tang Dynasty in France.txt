BEIJING, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron have respectively inscribed prefaces to an exhibition titled "Tang China -- A Cosmopolitan Dynasty (7th-10th Century)," which was inaugurated Monday at France's Guimet National Museum of Asian Arts.
Noting that this year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France, Xi said the two countries reached an agreement to hold an exhibition of Tang Dynasty artifacts at the Guimet Museum during his visit to France in May.
Xi said he is very happy to see the exhibition open as scheduled, thanks to the joint efforts of cultural relics experts from both countries. â–

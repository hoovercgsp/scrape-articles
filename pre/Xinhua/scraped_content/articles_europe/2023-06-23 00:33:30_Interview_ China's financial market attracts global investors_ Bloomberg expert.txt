LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Global investors have shown great interest in China's financial market, as the world's second-largest market has become unavoidable for them, Li Bing, head of Bloomberg Asia Pacific has said.
Bloomberg surveyed over 150 financial institutions in Hong Kong last week as part of an event, and more than 50 percent said they were still optimistic or cautiously optimistic about the Chinese market, Li told Xinhua in a recent interview in London.
"Overall, I think it is a very positive message," said Li, a veteran financial expert who has been working in the industry for over 20 years.
Li said it is not just the size of the Chinese financial market that attracts global investors, but also the fact that the market is still actively evolving after many years of opening up to foreign investment.
From the 'stock connect' and 'bond connect' programs to the recently launched 'swap connect' program, an interest rate swap market access scheme between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, all those elements adding together provide a lot of potential for foreign investors, said Li.
This very large market is becoming easier and easier to access, he said.
He said that the increasing level of communication and engagement, especially after the pandemic, will help global investors feel more optimistic and comfortable about the Chinese market.
"In Bloomberg, our belief is that a more connected international market is better for everyone," said Li, noting that after years of difficulties in face-to-face communication, global investors are now playing a catch-up game with the Chinese market.
Bloomberg has recently hosted several China-focused seminars in several financial hubs to discuss the latest developments in China's financial market and the opportunities that lie ahead. â–

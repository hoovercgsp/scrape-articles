Addressing the opening ceremony, Iuri Nozadze, deputy minister of environmental protection and agriculture of Georgia, hailed the close partnership between Georgia and China in recent years.
The exhibition will further strengthen the economic and trade cooperation between Georgia and China and will help boost the development of the two countries, he said.
According to Zhou Qian, China's ambassador to Georgia, the trade volume between China's Xinjiang autonomous region and Georgia has increased about four times and the investment volume has doubled in the past decade.

Title: Public safety, social stability top on Procuratorates agenda
Date: Nov 19, 2024

The Supreme People's Procuratorate on Tuesday urged procuratorate organs to rigorously review vicious criminal offenses for arrest and prosecution to ensure public safety and to enhance people's sense of security.
Protecting people's life and social security should be prioritized, according to a statement released by SPP after a meeting on better maintaining social stability, which was held following a car ramming incident in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, that killed 35 people and injured 43 on Nov 11.
The incident occurred at the Sports Center in Zhuhai, resulting in significant casualties and severe consequences.
The case holds significant guiding importance for procuratorate organs in lawfully punishing and preventing extreme violent crimes, as well as fully ensuring the safety of people's lives and social stability, Ying Yong, prosecutor-general of the SPP said last week during an inspection trip in Shanghai.
SPP also said in the statement on Tuesday that procuratorate organs will maintain a "zero-tolerance" stance on crimes against students and endangering campus security by eliminating public safety risks near schools with relevant departments.
It added that procuratorate organs should thoroughly investigate risks and hidden dangers and ensure fair and lawful handling of cases. They must promote the rule of law in petition work and resolve conflicts involving prosecution cases at the early stage to prevent the spread of risks.

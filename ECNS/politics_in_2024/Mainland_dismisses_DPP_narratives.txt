Title: Mainland dismisses DPP narratives
Date: Dec 12, 2024

The Chinese mainland on Wednesday dismissed allegations by Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party that it is using social media influencers from the island for "united front" tactics, calling the claims an attempt to manipulate public opinion and stoke cross-Strait tensions.
The allegations stem from a recent documentary featuring Taiwan rapper Chen Po-yuan, which accuses the mainland of covertly influencing Taiwan's public opinion. The documentary has sparked heated debate in Taiwan.
Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said the accusations are "clumsy tactics" by the DPP to stage "cognitive warfare" and create fear.
"This is yet another orchestrated effort by the DPP to manipulate narratives and foster a climate of 'green terror,'" Zhu said at a press briefing.
She added that this year has seen an increasing number of Taiwan residents sharing their experiences traveling and interacting on the mainland via online platforms. These firsthand accounts, Zhu said, have challenged the "information cocoon" created by the DPP, prompting the DPP to intensify suppression and intimidation efforts.
Zhu cited examples such as claims that mainland journalists interfere with Taiwan's media program production, accusations of inviting Taiwan celebrities to form political parties and allegations of recruiting influencers to promote the culture of the mainland.
"These baseless accusations have been met with strong opposition from netizens on both sides of the Strait," she said.
"We will continue to promote exchanges across all fields and welcome more Taiwan residents, particularly young people, to visit the mainland," Zhu said. "We encourage them to see the mainland firsthand, deepen their understanding and develop their own perspectives."

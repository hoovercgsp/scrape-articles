Date: Nov 15, 2024

In response to an inquiry about reports of former Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's reported visit to Canada, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China's stance on the Taiwan question remains consistent and clear. China firmly opposes any visits by "Taiwan independence" separatists to countries that have diplomatic ties with China, regardless of the excuses.
Tsai is planning to visit Canada next week, Reuters reported, citing two diplomatic sources.
"We urged relevant countries to uphold the one-China principle and take concrete steps to preserve the political foundation of their bilateral relations with China," Lin said.

Title: World's largest pumped storage station begins full operation in China
Date: Dec 31, 2024

(ECNS) -- The last variable-speed generating unit of the State Grid Hebei Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station commenced commercial operation on Tuesday, making it the largest such facility in the world.
Located in Fengning Manchu Autonomous County, Chengde City, Hebei Province, Fengning Power Station lies adjacent to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei load center and the 10 GW-level renewable energy base in northern Hebei.
The station has a total installed capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts, with an annual designed power generation of 6.612 billion kilowatt-hours and an annual water pumping capacity of 8.716 billion kilowatt-hours.
According to the State Grid Corporation of China, since the first batch of units began operation in December 2021, Fengning Power Station has cumulatively generated 8.616 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and absorbed 10.902 billion kilowatt-hours of renewable energy. It has effectively served as a stabilizer, regulator, and balancer for the power grid.
Fully operational, the station is expected to save 480,800 metric tons of standard coal annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.2 million tons, playing a significant role in optimizing the energy structure and reducing carbon emissions.

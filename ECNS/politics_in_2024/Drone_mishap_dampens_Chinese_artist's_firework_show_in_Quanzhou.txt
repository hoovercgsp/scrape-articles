(ECNS) -- Renowned Chinese contemporary artist Cai Guoqiang staged his much-anticipated daytime fireworks performance, Red Sail: A Pyrotechnic Plan for the Launch of the Cai Guoqiang Contemporary Art Center, in his hometown of Quanzhou on Sunday. However, the event encountered an unexpected interruption in which a large number of drones fell into the sea or crashed to the ground.
The performance, a visually striking fusion of drones and low-altitude fireworks, was a tribute to the themes of Quanzhou’s rich history, traditional culture, and the role of women. The show featured a floating boat accompanied by black and white smoke trails, and a drone-formed sailboat that transitioned in color from golden orange to purple before disappearing into the twilight.
Witnesses reported that while the drone crash did not cause any injuries, a portion of the show was disrupted. The cause of the incident is still under investigation.
Cai, known for his bold artistic expression, asked the audience to help collect the fallen drones, with the plea not to take them home.
The event took place on the grounds of the future Cai Guoqiang Contemporary Art Center in Quanzhou, where the artist plans to establish a world-class landmark. The center’s design, by famed architect Frank Gehry, draws from both the traditional culture of Southern Fujian and the artist’s signature pyrotechnic style.
Despite the mishap, the performance remains a milestone in Cai’s journey, symbolizing his deep connection to his hometown and the longstanding friendships and family ties behind his artistic legacy.
Cai expressed that Red Sail was also a homage to the groundbreaking architectural project, marking Gehry’s first building in the Chinese mainland. He emphasized the significance of returning to his roots in Quanzhou.

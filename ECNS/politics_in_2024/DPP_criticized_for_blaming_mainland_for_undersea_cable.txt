Title: DPP criticized for blaming mainland for undersea cable
Date: Jan 9, 2025

A Chinese mainland spokesman on Wednesday accused the Democratic Progressive Party authorities in Taiwan of purposefully sensationalizing a recent undersea cable incident near Taiwan and unjustly blaming the mainland.
Chen Binhua, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to an incident involving an undersea communication cable near Keelung Port, reportedly damaged by a vessel's anchor that belonged to a Chinese.
The DPP administration alleged that the cable damage was not simply an "innocent accident," expressing concerns that such "gray zone" operations by the mainland, falling short of open warfare, represent an escalation, as reported by Taiwan media.
Chen said that globally, there are over a hundred incidents of undersea cable damage annually, a common outcome of maritime accidents.
He criticized the DPP administration for baselessly speculating and intentionally sensationalizing the cable incident as a supposed "threat" from the mainland, despite the facts and responsibility for the accident remaining unclear.
"This behavior demonstrates that the DPP manipulates the anti-mainland narrative without ethical boundaries," he added.

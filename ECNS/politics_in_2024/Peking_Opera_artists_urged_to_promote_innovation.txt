Date: Jan 11, 2025

President Xi Jinping has encouraged young artists to uphold tradition while promoting innovation to ensure that traditional Peking Opera remains vibrant and relevant in the modern era.
Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in a reply letter to young artists of China's National Peking Opera Company.
Peking Opera, a UNESCO-recognized intangible cultural heritage dating back over 200 years, is a performance art incorporating singing, reciting, acting and martial arts.
Friday marked the 70th anniversary of the company's founding. The company's young artists recently wrote to Xi to share their efforts in passing down Peking Opera traditions. They pledged their dedication to advancing the art form and promoting China's rich cultural heritage.
In his reply letter, Xi extended his congratulatory greetings and warm regards to all the performers and staff of the company on its 70th anniversary.
Xi noted that since its founding, the company has delivered numerous classic performances and nurtured a rich pool of talented artists.
He expressed the hope that the company, at a new starting point, would continue to play a vital role in promoting the art form and contribute to the building of a nation strong in culture.
He also called on the artists to uphold virtue and artistic excellence, and remain true to tradition while embracing innovation.
The National Peking Opera Company traces its origins to the China Peking Opera Company, established on Jan 10, 1955, with renowned artist Mei Lanfang serving as its first president. The company adopted its current name in 2007.

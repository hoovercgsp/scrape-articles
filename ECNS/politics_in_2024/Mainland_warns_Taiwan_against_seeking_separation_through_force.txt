Title: Mainland warns Taiwan against seeking separation through force
Date: Dec 1, 2024


An attempt by the Lai Ching-te administration in Taiwan to seek separation through force will only lead to danger in the island and its self-destruction, a Chinese mainland spokesman said on Sunday.
Chen Binhua, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks following the announcement by the United States' Department of Defense on Saturday approving a $385 million arms sale to Taiwan.
Chen said that the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan constitute a serious violation of the provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and the mainland firmly opposes this.
The U.S. should fulfill its solemn political commitment of not supporting "Taiwan independence" through concrete actions, cease arming Taiwan, and refrain from sending erroneous signals to separatist forces, he said.
Chen warned Lai's administration in Taiwan that purchasing weapons cannot buy security, paying "protection fees" to the U.S. cannot ensure "Taiwan independence".
"The Taiwan question is a core interest of China, and no individual or force should underestimate the resolute will and formidable capabilities of the Chinese people in defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.

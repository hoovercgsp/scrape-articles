Date: Dec 21, 2024

Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of sympathy on Friday to Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi over the devastating Cyclone Chido that wreaked havoc in the African country, expressing China's willingness to provide assistance within its capacity to support the nation's post-disaster reconstruction.
In his message, Xi said he was shocked to learn about the casualties and property losses caused by the cyclone. "On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend my heartfelt condolences over the victims, and offer my sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured," Xi said.
The Chinese people stand firmly with the Mozambican people at this challenging time, Xi added.
The cyclone, which struck the provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula in Mozambique, caused widespread devastation, displacing thousands and damaging critical infrastructure.
The death toll from Cyclone Chido in Mozambique has climbed to 73, with 543 people reported injured, the country's disaster relief agency announced on Thursday.
Humanitarian organizations have begun providing emergency aid while issuing urgent appeals for additional funding to assist about 182,000 people affected.
Mozambique started on Friday a two-day national mourning for the victims.
The cyclone made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday. It has left the country and is no longer a threat to it.

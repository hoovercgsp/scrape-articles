Title: Former senior political adviser confesses to accepting over 261 million yuan in bribes
Date: Dec 13, 2024

Han Yong, a former senior Chinese political adviser, admitted Thursday to accepting bribes totaling more than 261 million yuan ($35.9 million) during a trial at the Nanning Intermediate People's Court in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.
Han, 67, previously served as chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and deputy director of the Committee of Population, Resources, and Environment of the CPPCC National Committee.
Prosecutors accused Han of using his official positions and influence from 1993 to 2023 to seek benefits for individuals and entities in areas such as business operations, project contracting, and personnel appointments. In exchange, he allegedly accepted illegal payments totaling more than 261 million yuan.
Originally from Jilin province, Han began his career in 1974 and joined the Communist Party in 1976. He held various positions in Jilin, including general-procurator of Songyuan and deputy general-procurator of the Jilin Provincial Procuratorate, before being transferred to the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region in 2004.
In Xinjiang, Han served as deputy Party chief and later moved to Shaanxi province, where he chaired the provincial CPPCC committee until 2022. He also served as deputy director of the CPPCC's Committee of Population, Resources, and Environment until his retirement in 2023.
Han came under investigation in October 2023, shortly after retiring. During the trial, prosecutors recommended criminal charges for bribery. Han expressed guilt and remorse.
The court will announce the sentencing at a later date.

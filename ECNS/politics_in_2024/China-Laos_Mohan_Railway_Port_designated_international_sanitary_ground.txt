(ECNS) -- The Mohan Railway Port on the China-Laos Railway was designated as an international sanitary ground crossing by the World Health Organization following an on-site assessment on Tuesday.
The designation highlights the port's capacity to address international public health emergencies.
Since the China-Laos Railway began operations on Dec. 3, 2021, concerted efforts have significantly improved the environmental hygiene and health service standards at Mohan Railway Port in Southwest China's Yunnan Province.
These improvements have ensured the safe cross-border travel of over 400,000 people from more than 100 countries and regions, as well as the transport of over 10 million tons of cross-border goods involving 19 countries and regions.

Title: China criticizes Japan for politicizing cybersecurity issues
Date: Jan 10, 2025

China firmly opposed politicizing cybersecurity issues and hoped countries can approach the issues with an objective, fair, and professional attitude, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Thursday.
Guo made the remarks as Japan linked more than 200 cyberattacks over the past five years targeting the country's national security and high technology data to a Chinese hacking group, MirrorFace.
"China firmly opposes and cracks down on hacking activities according to the law," Guo told a daily news briefing.
"It is neither professional nor responsible for Japanese authorities to make such judgments based solely on the targets and methods of the cyberattacks", he said, as cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and has diverse actors.
The spokesman noted that some allies of the United States have recently collaborated with Washington in spreading false information about China.
"It is hoped that all parties can base their actions on facts, follow international rules, and handle cybersecurity issues in an objective, fair and professional manner, rather than playing supporting roles in political farces," Guo said.

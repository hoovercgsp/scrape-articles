Title: Foreign Ministry has new spokesperson
Date: Jan 6, 2025

Guo Jiakun, the 35th Foreign Ministry spokesperson, made his debut at Monday's daily news conference.
Guo, 44, has been working in the Foreign Ministry for 23 years and is experienced in both diplomacy and communication.
"I will try my best to timely and accurately explain China's foreign policy and practices of Chinese modernization," Guo told journalists.
He said he expects to work with journalists to present an accurate, multidimensional and panoramic image of China to the world.
The Foreign Ministry introduced the system of spokespersons in 1983, making it the first government department in China to start such a practice. It is also the only government department that holds routine news briefings on every working day.

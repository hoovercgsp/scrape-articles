Title: Outreach offices give people a say in nation-building process
Date: Dec 27, 2024

Top legislature's initiative acts as bridge between people and national legislators
Guo Shun, an official in Guangzhou's Nansha district, has spent recent weeks canvassing opinions on proposed amendments to China's Maritime Law, engaging with stakeholders in one of the nation's busiest port hubs.
Working alongside colleagues, Guo distributed surveys to shipping companies, law firms, insurance agencies and local law enforcement, collecting feedback from captains, crew members, carriers and legal professionals. The draft amendment, disclosed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in early November, aims to strengthen protections for maritime passengers, among other changes.
Located at Guangzhou's southernmost tip, Nansha serves as a critical shipping hub connecting the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong and Macao. Guo said the district's unique position offers valuable insights into the proposed legislation.
"Our location gives us a distinct advantage in shipping and trade affairs, enabling us to contribute meaningful suggestions to the law revision process," Guo said.
The outreach is part of a broader initiative by the NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission to enhance public participation in legislation. Since its establishment in March, Nansha's legislative outreach office has become a key link between citizens and lawmakers.
Describing the office as a "bridge" connecting the public with national legislators, Guo said, "It embodies the whole-process people's democracy, ensuring that the people are the masters of the country."
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of NPC, China's top legislature. The system of people's congresses facilitates public input at all levels of governance. To expand this, the NPC began establishing outreach offices in 2015, starting with pilot locations in Shanghai, Gansu, Jiangxi and Hubei.
As of June, 45 such offices have been set up nationwide, collecting more than 27,880 suggestions on 183 legislative items, according to NPC data. Of these, over 3,200 proposals have been incorporated into laws and amendments.
Guo emphasized that the outreach process not only informs legislation but also educates the public about their rights. He highlighted the significance of informing maritime workers about the draft revision, which would allow passengers injured or experiencing property damage during sea travel to seek compensation from carriers and insurers.
"Many workers in the shipping industry are unaware of the law, let alone the channels they have to voice concerns or propose solutions," he said.
To ensure thorough and informed feedback, the Nansha office has hosted seminars with legal professionals from Hong Kong, Macao and Chinese mainland. At one session, Ding Ziyong, a maritime law specialist, urged lawmakers to prioritize rules on transporting dangerous goods, citing the risks of chemical spills during collisions.
Suggestions like Ding's, alongside feedback from port staff, will be forwarded to the NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission for consideration in revising the law.
"Even if some suggestions are not adopted, the process is invaluable," Guo said. "It gives people a direct voice in legislation, reinforcing their role as masters of the country."
Legislative outreach offices are also being established in diverse settings, from community centers to colleges. Beijing's Financial Street Service Bureau opened an office last year, and others are being set up in subdistricts and urban neighborhoods.
Jiang Bixin, deputy head of the China Law Society, praised the initiative, saying it "diversifies public participation and improves the quality of lawmaking."
Anne Lafortune, the Seychelles ambassador to China, echoed that sentiment during a visit to an outreach office in Beijing in May. "China's approach to ensuring people's voices are heard is impressive," she said, highlighting channels like online platforms, direct calls and legislative deputies.
By amplifying public engagement in lawmaking, Guo said, China is showing its commitment to refining governance and fostering a more inclusive democracy.

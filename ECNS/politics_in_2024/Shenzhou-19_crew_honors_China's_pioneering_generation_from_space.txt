Shenzhou-19 crew honors China's pioneering generation from space.
(ECNS) -- The Shenzhou-19 crew, currently on duty at the China Space Station, paid tribute to the pioneering generation of space explorers in their video message on Wednesday, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Shenzhou-1's successful launch.
On Nov. 20, 1999, China’s first unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-1, was successfully launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. After 21 hours in space, its return capsule safely landed in the early hours of the following day.
"China's manned space program took its first step from dream to reality, establishing a solid foundation for realizing the millennia-old Chinese aspiration of exploring space," said Cai Xuzhe, commander of the Shenzhou-19 crew and a second-time spacefarer, in the video.
Song Lingdong, China’s first male astronaut born in the 1990s, reflected on the journey, saying, "Over the past 25 years, generations of space explorers have persevered with confidence and determination, continuously reaching new heights in China’s pursuit of the cosmos. They have penned a magnificent chapter of intertwining the Chinese Dream with the dream of space exploration in the vast universe."
Wang Haoze, China’s first female astronaut to serve as a flight engineer, emphasized that space exploration is one of humanity's greatest endeavors, and "an endless journey of discovery." She called on her peer astronauts to "stand on the shoulders of giants, continue the ascent, and run their leg of history’s relay race with dedication."
On Oct. 30, a Long March-2F carrier rocket launched the Shenzhou-19 manned spacecraft, sending the three astronauts into space. This mission represents the 33rd launch since the inception of China’s manned space program.
To date, the country has launched 19 Shenzhou spacecraft, sending 24 astronauts into space across 38 missions.

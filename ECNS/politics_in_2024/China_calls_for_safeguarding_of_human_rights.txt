Date: Dec 9, 2024

China called for safeguarding human rights on Monday, through security, promoting human rights through development, and advancing human rights through cooperation to facilitate the healthy and sustainable development of global human rights.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the remarks when addressing via a letter an international dialogue on economic, social and cultural rights held in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province.
Wang underlined the importance of ensuring everyone enjoys equal economic, social, and cultural rights, saying it is an important goal for achieving all human rights against the backdrop of an exacerbation of deficits in human rights governance.
He called for the adherence of genuine multilateralism, respecting the human rights development paths chosen independently by each country and promoting dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
Efforts should be made to address development imbalances through increasing investment in economic, social and cultural rights, he said, urging developed countries to provide greater support to developing countries to ensure that no one is left behind.
Wang said China has embarked on a path of human rights development that is in line with the trends of the times and suited to its national conditions, reaching new heights in guaranteeing economic, social, and cultural rights.
China will continue to work with countries and United Nations agencies to uphold the common values of humanity and promote the development of global human rights, he added.

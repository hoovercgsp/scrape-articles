Title: Canadian institutions, individuals sanctioned
Date: Dec 23, 2024

China has taken countermeasures against two Canadian institutions and 20 individuals involved in issues related to its Xinjiang Uygur and Xizang autonomous regions, the Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.
According to the decision, which took effect on Saturday, all movable and immovable property, as well as other types of assets, held by the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project and the Canada-Tibet Committee and their staff have been frozen.
The decision prohibits organizations and individuals within China from engaging in transactions, cooperation and other activities with the two institutions and relevant personnel.
China will also deny visas to the 20 individuals and ban their entry into the country, including to the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions.
The countermeasures were taken after Canada announced earlier this month sanctions against eight former and serving Chinese officials, citing so-called human rights violations in Xinjiang and Xizang.
Beijing made serious protests and expressed strong condemnation to Ottawa, calling on Canada to immediately rectify its wrongdoing, and vowing to take all measures necessary to firmly safeguard China's sovereignty, security and development interests.
At a news conference earlier this month, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning dismissed the sanctions as an "ugly, hypocritical political stunt done by some Canadian political figures under the pretext of human rights to serve an unspeakable agenda and please the United States".

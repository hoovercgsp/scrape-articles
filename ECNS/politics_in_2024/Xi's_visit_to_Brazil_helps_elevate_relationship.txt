President Xi Jinping arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday afternoon for the 19th G20 Summit and a state visit to Brazil.
In written remarks delivered at the airport, Xi noted ties between China and Brazil are now at a critical historical juncture as the two nations celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year.
"I have made four visits to Brazil before, and witnessed firsthand the development and changes in the nation over the past 30 years," he said. "Stepping onto this land of hospitality once more makes me feel particularly warm."
China and Brazil are good friends and partners sharing common aspirations in their shared paths forward, he said, adding that the two nations, despite being oceans apart, have appealed to, and resonated with, each other.
Xi expressed expectations that he will conduct an in-depth exchange of opinions with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva over further elevating bilateral ties, stepping up alignment in development strategies, and international and regional issues of common concern.
"I believe this visit will further enhance the two nations' political mutual trust, deepen exchanges and cooperation across various fields and usher in a new â€˜golden 50 years' for China-Brazil relations."
The president also conveyed his expectations for the 19th G20 Summit, saying that he looks forward to working with various sides to plan development together, and jointly advocating an equal, orderly and multipolar world and economic globalization that is inclusive and beneficial to all.

Date: Nov 28, 2024

In response to the U.S. State Department relaxing its travel advisory for China and removing the notation that indicates a risk of wrongful detention, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China has taken note of the U.S. adjustment and believes that this move is beneficial for normal exchanges between the two countries.
China has always opposed artificially creating a "chilling effect" and hopes that the U.S. will continue to create more conveniences to promote people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, said Mao.
The State Department downgraded its travel advisory for China from level three "reconsider travel" to a level two "exercise increased caution" on Wednesday, according to a Politico report.

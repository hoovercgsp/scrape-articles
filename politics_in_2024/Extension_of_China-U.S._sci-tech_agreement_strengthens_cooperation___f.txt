Date: Dec 17, 2024

(ECNS) -- The extension of the Agreement Between the United States and China on Cooperation in Science and Technology (STA) is in the interest of both peoples, and what the international community hopes to see, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday.
On last Friday, the representatives of the Chinese and U.S. governments signed in Beijing a protocol to amend STA and extend it for an additional five years, effective from Aug. 27, 2024, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian.
The STA is one of the first government-to-government agreements signed between the two countries after establishment of diplomatic ties, and has been a strong buttress for scientific exchange and cooperation between the two countries, Lin remarked.
Lin further stated that the extension of STA will not only contribute to both countries’ science and technology advancement and socioeconomic development, but also enable China and the U.S. to respond to global challenges together, which will in turn benefit people around the world.
Lin said that China hope the U.S. will work with China to earnestly implement the agreement so that the two sides’ cooperation in science and technology can truly deliver for both countries and the world.

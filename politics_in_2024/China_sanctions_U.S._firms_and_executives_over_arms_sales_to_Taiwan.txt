Title: China sanctions U.S. firms and executives over arms sales to Taiwan
Date: Dec 5, 2024

(ECNS) -- China decided to impose countermeasures against 13 U.S. military companies and six senior executives for arms sales to the Taiwan region, according to a decree issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.
The United States recently has approved a $385 million arms sale to Taiwan, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, interferes in China’s internal affairs, and undermines China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Chinese Foreign Ministry said the decision to impose sanctions was based on the Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 15 of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions. Consequently, the movable and immovable properties, and other kinds of assets within China of the above-mentioned businesses and personnel shall be frozen.
Furthermore, they shall be denied visas or entry into China (including Hong Kong and Macao). All organizations and individuals within China shall be prohibited from engaging in transaction, cooperation and other activities with them, according to the decision, which shall come into force from Dec. 5, 2024.

Date: Nov 20, 2024

China and Germany should continue consolidating their all-around strategic partnership "from a long-term and strategic perspective", and further enable each other's success, President Xi Jinping said when meeting on Tuesday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the sidelines of the 19th G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
During the meeting, Xi said that Beijing is willing to work with Berlin to uphold respect for each other's core interests and major concerns, and seek common ground while reserving differences.
China will "continue to provide broad market opportunities for German enterprises", and the two sides should focus on digitalization, intelligence and low-carbonization to upgrade their cooperation and work hand in hand to develop third-party markets, Xi said.
Noting that it is crucial for Germany and China to strengthen communication and cooperation, Scholz said that Germany looks to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral dialogues and cooperation in the spirit of equality, frankness and mutual respect, properly resolve differences, achieve mutual benefits, and contribute to global economic growth.
Regarding China-European Union relations, Xi said the EU's tariff levy on electric vehicles produced in China has sparked worldwide concern. China has always adhered to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation, he said.
Scholz expressed his hope that the EU and China will soon resolve the EV issue through dialogue and negotiation, saying that Germany is willing to take active steps in this regard.

Title: BRICS countries aim for common prosperity: Chinese FM
Date: Dec 3, 2024

As an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries, the BRICS countries advocate for openness and inclusiveness and win-win cooperation. They do not engage in bloc confrontation, and do not target third parties. They aim to achieve mutual development and common prosperity, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday, responding to a question over US President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on BRICS countries if they create a new BRICS currency to replace the US dollar.
China is willing to work with BRICS partners to deepen pragmatic cooperation in various industries and make more contributions for sustained global economic growth, Lin said.

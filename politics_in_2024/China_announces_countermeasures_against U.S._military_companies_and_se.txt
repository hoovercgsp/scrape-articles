Title: China announces countermeasures against U.S. military companies and senior executives
Date: Dec 27, 2024

(ECNS) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Friday countermeasures against seven U.S. military companies and relevant senior executives in response to recent U.S. actions.
The decision follows the U.S. announcement of substantial military assistance and arms sales to China’s Taiwan region, as well as the inclusion of multiple negative sections on China in its "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025."
“These seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” according to China’s Foreign Ministry.
Pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 15 of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions, China decided to take countermeasures against seven companies as listed in the attached List of Targets of Countermeasures, i.e., Insitu, Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International, Inc., and relevant senior executives:
Their movable and immovable properties and other kinds of assets within China shall be frozen.
All organizations and individuals within China shall be prohibited from engaging in transaction, cooperation and other activities with them.
This decision took effect immediately upon its announcement on Dec. 27, 2024.

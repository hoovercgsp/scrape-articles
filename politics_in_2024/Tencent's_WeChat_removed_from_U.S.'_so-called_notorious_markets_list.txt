Title: Tencent's WeChat removed from U.S.' so-called notorious markets list
Date: Jan 9, 2025

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has removed Chinese social media leader Tencent's WeChat from its so-called Notorious Markets List for 2024, according to the USTR's website on Wednesday. The company was included in the 2023 list.
Tencent declined to comment as of press time.
Over the past few years, Tencent has strongly contested the USTR's decision to include it on the list and has repeatedly communicated to the U.S. body its efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection, according to a post on a company-related WeChat account on Thursday.
Earlier this week, the U.S. added several Chinese companies including Tencent and Chinese battery maker CATL to a Pentagon list of firms which the U.S. claimed to have working relationship with the Chinese military, prompting rebuttals from Chinese companies.
Tencent refuted its inclusion, describing it as a mistake.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry (FM) spokesperson said on Tuesday that China strongly opposes the U.S.'s overreach in using national security concerns, making discriminatory lists in various names and going after Chinese companies to contain China's high-quality development.
"The Chinese people's right to development cannot be deprived or overlooked. We urge the U.S. to immediately correct its wrongdoings, and end the illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese companies," FM spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, adding that China will take all measures necessary to firmly defend the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and uphold its legitimate right to development.

Date: Dec 12, 2024

(ECNS) -- The Huangmaohai Sea-Crossing Passage, a major project in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) connecting Zhuhai and Jiangmen, officially opened on Wednesday afternoon, shortening travel time between the two cities from over an hours to about 30 minutes.
The project's construction started in June 2020, and serves as another major cross-sea passage following the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge and the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link in the GBA.
The link serves as the western extension of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge, starting in Pingsha Town in the city of Zhuhai and ends in Doushan Town in the city of Taishan, spanning approximately 31 kilometers.
The project consists of two main bridges -- Huangmaohai Bridge and Gaolan Port Bridge, two tunnels, four interchanges, and one service area.
It is designed as a six-lane expressway with a speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour and a 100-year service life.
According to CCTV, tolls will be temporarily waived during the initial opening period, with details about future fees to be announced later.
The project applies an innovative version of the information technology toll collection system, AI intelligent analysis, and an automatic drone take-off and landing patrol system to enhance traffic flow and emergency response efficiency.

Date: Dec 17, 2024

In response to an inquiry regarding claim by the Taiwan island's "defense ministry" that it had received 38 advanced Abrams battle tanks from the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Monday that there is no such a thing as the so-called "defense ministry" in Taiwan. Lin added that China firmly opposes military ties between the U.S. and the Taiwan island, opposes U.S. arms sales to the island, stressing that China's position on this remains consistent and clear.
in also urged the U.S. to adhere to the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqu√©s, especially the August 17 Communique, and to stop arming the Taiwan island or supporting "Taiwan independence" forces in their attempts to seek independence through military means.
Lin pointed out that the island of Taiwan authorities' attempts to "seek independence through military means" and "rely on foreign forces for independence" are doomed to fail. He emphasized that China will firmly safeguard its national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity.
The first batch of U.S.-made M1A2T tanks sold to the Taiwan island reportedly arrived in Taipei on Sunday following the arrival of accessory equipment of the tanks in Kaohsiung on Friday, but a military expert from Chinese mainland said the tanks, trumpeted by media on the island as "the most powerful combat vehicle on the ground," are too bulky and heavy for island combat and will only serve as easy targets for drones and attack helicopters.

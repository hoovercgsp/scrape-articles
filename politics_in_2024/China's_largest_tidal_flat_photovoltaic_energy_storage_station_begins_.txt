Title: China's largest tidal flat photovoltaic energy storage station begins operation
Date: Jan 7, 2025

(ECNS) — The largest tidal flat photovoltaic energy storage station in China, constructed by Huadian Laizhou Power Generation Co Ltd. on the salt-alkali tidal flats of the shores of Bohai Bay, has officially begun operations on Tuesday.
Spanning an area of 18,000 acres, the project features nearly 2 million photovoltaic panels. It integrates solar power generation with salt production, creating a synergistic industrial model. Beneath the photovoltaic panels, brine is infused into salt ponds, enabling local communities to benefit from increased salt production and economic growth.
As one of China’s third batch of large-scale wind and photovoltaic bases, the project boasts an installed capacity of 1,000 MW, supported by a 200 MW/400 MWh energy storage system.
The station will generate 1.442 billion kWh of electricity annually, sufficient to meet the electricity needs of approximately 500,000 households, according to Huadian Laizhou Power Generation Co Ltd. It is expected to save 444,000 tons of standard coal each year, significantly reducing carbon emissions.

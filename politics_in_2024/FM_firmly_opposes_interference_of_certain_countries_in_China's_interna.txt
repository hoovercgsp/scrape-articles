Date: Nov 21, 2024

In response to Jimmy Lai testifying in a trial in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that Jimmy Lai is a major mastermind and participant of the anti-China riots in Hong Kong and an agent and pawn of the anti-China forces, noting that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government upholds national security in accordance with the Basic Law and the National Security Law for Hong Kong, which is well-founded in law and reason and beyond reproach.
Lin said that Hong Kong is a society under the rule of law, and to abide by the law and bring lawbreakers to justice is a basic principle. No one should be allowed to use "democracy" as a pretext to engage in unlawful activities and escape justice, Lin said.
The judicial authorities in Hong Kong exercise judicial power independently under the law , ensuring that the procedures are fair and just, and that court hearings are transparent, the spokesperson said.
The Central Government firmly supports the HKSAR in safeguarding national security in accordance with the law and punishing all acts that undermine national security, and firmly opposes interference from certain countries in China's internal affairs and their attempts to undermine Hong Kong's rule of law using this case, Lin said.

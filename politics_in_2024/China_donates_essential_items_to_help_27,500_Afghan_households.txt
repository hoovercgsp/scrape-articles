Date: Dec 10, 2024

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) will distribute essential relief items, donated by China, to more than 175,000 conflict-affected internally displaced Afghans across the country in the coming weeks.
The donation, from China Aid's Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, will support more than 27,500 households, who are struggling to meet their basic needs, according to the agency.
The relief items, including kitchen sets, blankets, jerry cans and plastic tarpaulins, will be packed into family sets and distributed to displaced households, it said in a statement on Sunday.
Afghanistan continues to face one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced by conflict.
Speaking at a handover ceremony in Kabul, Ma Chenguang, counsellor at the Chinese embassy in Afghanistan, said the donated items are expected to provide help to some of the most vulnerable people in Afghanistan as winter approaches, according to the UNHRC statement.
"We are immensely grateful for this important support from China Aid. It enables UNHCR to support displaced families who are struggling in difficult times so that they can meet their basic needs. UNHCR remains committed to helping the most vulnerable in communities across Afghanistan, especially women and girls," UNHCR's Representative in Afghanistan Arafat Jamal said.

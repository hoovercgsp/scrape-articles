Pivotal moment in relationship signals next phase of cooperation between two countries
When President Xi Jinping arrived at the Elysee Palace for a state banquet during his visit to France in May, it was evident that the event was more than a mere diplomatic formality.
The grandeur and meticulous attention to detail were a reflection of the deep respect and long-standing ties between China and France, according to Wang Peiwen, president of the China-France Friendship Association in Montargis in central France, who was among the distinguished guests.
"I found it especially interesting when the Elysee Palace band performed Chinese songs," she said. Jasmine Flower and The Moon Represents My Heart, two Chinese household songs, were performed during the state banquet.
"It was clear that President (Emmanuel) Macron and the French government placed significant importance on welcoming the Chinese head of state," she said.
Xi's visit marked a pivotal moment in the evolving relationship between the two nations, signaling a new phase of cooperation that could shape not only Sino-French relations, but also China's broader engagement with Europe.
His discussions with President Macron spanned urgent global issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence governance, and strategic geopolitical challenges, particularly surrounding the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel conflict.
Xi emphasized the importance of building on the 60-year relationship between China and France, one that predates China's formal ties with many other Western countries.
Wang highlighted that one of the most significant outcomes of the visit was the commitment to increase the number of French students studying in China to over 10,000 and to double the scale of European youth exchanges within the next three years. Additionally, the visit facilitated visa-free travel to China for French citizens until the end of 2025.
"Local governments are actively preparing trips to China," Wang said, highlighting a noticeable uptick in interest from various sectors within France to deepen ties with China. This new chapter in diplomatic relations goes beyond symbolic gestures, with tangible impacts on education, business and local government engagement.
Sebastien Lion, vice-president of the French Institute for Tourism Development, highlighted the importance of extending the visa-free travel initiative following Xi's visit.
"To effectively work with China, you need to experience it firsthand," Lion said. "Understanding the culture and language can be beneficial, but the crucial first step is visiting China. Whether it's exploring provinces, big cities or rural areas, being there is essential. The ability to travel without needing a visa for a week or two is a significant advantage for business."
Lion organized a delegation to attend the China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
It was important "to communicate to the brands participating in this mission that they won't need a visa, which is a fantastic solution. I've heard that sometimes the visa application process can be quite complicated due to the numerous criteria that need to be fulfilled", he said.
Lion also noted that the positive climate established by Xi's recent visit has greatly contributed to a surge in Chinese delegations arriving in France. "There have been numerous delegations related to the Olympic Games and beyond," he added. "This trend is a promising sign, with leaders and influencers encouraging travel to France."
Far-reaching impact
Li Zhipeng, a researcher at the University of Poitiers and the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, echoed Lion's sentiments, emphasizing the far-reaching impact of Xi's visit.
"President Xi's visit broke through the Cold War mentality of some Western countries toward China," Li said. The visit not only reinvigorated Sino-French relations, but also elevated them to a new level â€” a comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era, he added.
During the three-day visit, Xi and Macron engaged in extended talks that far exceeded their original schedule. Li highlighted the informal, yet deeply symbolic moment when Xi and Macron shared a meal in the Pyrenees that featured local cheese as well as folk performances. This intimate gathering underscored the special friendship between the two leaders and reflected a broader sense of mutual understanding between their nations, he said.
Li also pointed to the concrete achievements of the visit, such as China's contribution to the success of the Paris 2024 Olympics. From Olympic sports equipment to high-tech LED displays, China's involvement was vital to the event's success, demonstrating the breadth of Sino-French cooperation across diverse fields, including infrastructure, technology and culture.
Moreover, academic and cultural exchanges that followed Xi's visit have continued to grow, particularly in higher education. An increasing number of French scholars are visiting China, while Chinese academic institutions are building stronger ties with their French counterparts. "This deepening cooperation in education will play a crucial role in furthering the European youth exchange program and fostering mutual understanding," Li said.
Geopolitical significance
Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin underscored the broader geopolitical significance of Xi's visit.
"We cannot envision the world's future without considering China, and likewise, it is not in China's interest to disregard Europe," Raffarin told China Daily.
He praised the discussions between Xi and Macron, which focused on pressing global challenges such as climate change and international security. Raffarin said these talks were timely and essential for fostering deeper cooperation, not just between China and France, but also for the broader international community.
Raffarin stressed the importance of continuous dialogue between China and France, suggesting that Macron is perhaps the Western leader who best understands Xi's worldview. Their shared commitment to multilateralism, despite occasional differences in perspective, offers a model for how global powers can engage in meaningful discussions to resolve pressing global issues, he added.
One area with strong potential for collaboration is environmental protection. Both Xi and Macron have prioritized tackling climate change, and Raffarin believes that their collaboration could set a global precedent. He also highlighted emerging technologies like AI as another key area in which China and France could lead the world in setting new regulatory frameworks.
Raffarin further noted that Xi's visit set a new standard for how major global powers should engage, especially as international tensions rise. He urged a return to cooperation over confrontation, particularly in Europe's relationship with China.
"In a world leaning toward confrontation, we need to steer back toward cooperation," Raffarin said, adding that such an approach could pave the way for a more stable and prosperous global community.

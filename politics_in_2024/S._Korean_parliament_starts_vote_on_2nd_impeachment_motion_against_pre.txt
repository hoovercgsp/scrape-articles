Title: S. Korean parliament starts vote on 2nd impeachment motion against president
Date: Dec 14, 2024

South Korea's National Assembly on Saturday started voting on a second impeachment motion against President Yoon Suk-yeol over his botched declaration of martial law.
The first motion to impeach the president was scrapped last Saturday due to a lack of quorum, with nearly all lawmakers from Yoon's ruling People Power Party boycotting the vote.
The ruling People Power Party decided to maintain its position to oppose the impeachment motion but not to boycott the vote, Yonhap news agency reported Saturday.

Title: Mainland spokesperson warns of harm to Taiwan's industries as DPP uses TSMC as 'pledge of allegiance' to court U.S.
Date: Dec 11, 2024

If the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) authorities persist in its unabated selling out of Taiwan, the competitive edge of Taiwan's related industries will inevitably be eroded, and the interests of local businesses and residents will invariably suffer, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson from the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Wednesday.
Zhu made the remarks during a regular press conference in response to inquiries regarding reports that the U.S. has requested Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to relocate its advanced processes to the U.S..
TSMC has become the DPP's "pledge of allegiance" to curry favor with the U.S.. As some public opinion on the island said, the DPP authorities are bent on seeking "Taiwan independence" by relying on the U.S. and it is only a matter of time before TSMC turns into "American Semiconductor Manufacturing Company," Zhu said.
If the DPP authorities continue to sell out of Taiwan without any bottom line, the competitive edge of Taiwan's related industries will undoubtedly be diminished, resulting in damaged interests for the island's enterprises and residents, Zhu said.
When Taiwan's value as a "pawn" is fully exploited, it will be abandoned, and businesses and the public on the island are becoming increasingly aware of this, Zhu noted.
Zhu added that it should be noted that numerous enterprises from Taiwan have achieved rapid growth through participating in cross-Straits cooperation, providing further evidence that joint efforts to strengthen the economic growth of the Chinese nation are the correct path.

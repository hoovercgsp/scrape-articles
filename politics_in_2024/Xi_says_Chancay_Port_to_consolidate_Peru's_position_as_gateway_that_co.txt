The Chancay Port will strongly consolidate Peru's position as a gateway that connects land and sea, Asia and Latin America, said Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday.
Xi made the remarks when attending the opening ceremony of the Chancay Port via video link with his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte.
The Chancay Port is not only a good deep-water port, but also the first smart port and green port in South America, which, when completed, will also bring Peru huge revenues and create a large number of jobs, Xi said.

Date: Dec 10, 2024

(ECNS) -- Authorities in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, are investigating a high-profile case that has drawn significant public attention after the recent discovery of a woman who had gone missing in 2011.
The woman, identified as Bu, was found living with abnormal mental health conditions and has since been placed in medical care.
Local authorities have confirmed that criminal measures have been taken against an individual believed to be involved in the case.
The investigation, which has raised concerns about potential abuse and exploitation, was triggered by the re-emergence of Bu’s case.
According to the Heshun County investigation team, Bu, 45, was last seen at home in Yuci District during May 2011.
Aftera struggle with mental health, she was found by a villager in Heshun that August, exhibiting signs of instability. Bu was subsequently taken in by 46-year-old Zhang, a local villager, with whom she had tow children.
Chinese authorities have now opened a criminal investigation into whether Zhang, aware of Bu’s mental health, sexually assaulted her and impregnated her without her consent. Zhang has been placed in custody as part of the investigation.
Further inquiries into the possibility of human trafficking have yielded no significant evidence linking Bu’s case to trafficking networks. The investigation found that Bu had spent several days in the area during the summer of 2011, but no leads have emerged to suggest she was forcibly taken.
The investigation is also looking into the possibility of unlawful detention or other criminal activities related to Bu’s prolonged stay with Zhang. Local villagers have indicated that while Bu’s mental health was visibly impaired, she frequently ventured out independently and was not seen as being confined.

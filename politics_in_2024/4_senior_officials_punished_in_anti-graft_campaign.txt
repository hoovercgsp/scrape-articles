Title: 4 senior officials punished in anti-graft campaign
Date: Dec 11, 2024

China's top anti-corruption and judicial authorities announced the punishment of four senior officials on Tuesday following investigations into bribery and misconduct.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate ordered the arrest of Tang Renjian, former minister of agriculture and rural affairs, on suspicion of bribes.
His case has been transferred to procuratorial authorities for prosecution after an investigation by the National Commission of Supervision. Tang was expelled from the Communist Party of China and dismissed from public office last month for serious violations of discipline and law.
Investigators found that Tang failed to implement central policies on agricultural affairs, accepted illegal gifts and travel invitations, and made poor decisions during the national poverty alleviation campaign. He also interfered with judicial matters and used his position to benefit his family and others in business and government affairs.
Separately, Wu Yingjie, a former Party chief of the Xizang autonomous region and senior member of China's top political advisory body, was expelled from the CPC and dismissed from his official roles for serious violations of Party discipline.
An investigation revealed that Wu mishandled local projects for personal gain and took bribes in exchange for benefits, including project contracts. His illegal assets will be confiscated, and his case will be transferred to prosecutors for prosecution.
Zhang Jianchun, former deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, was also expelled from the Party and removed from his public office after an investigation revealed he had violated Party rules.
Zhang accepted gifts, accommodation and travel arrangements that could influence his official duties, failed to cooperate with the investigation, and abused his power to secure benefits for others in exchange for bribes. His illicit gains have been confiscated, and the case will be referred to the procuratorate for further action.
Wang Bo, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Inner Mongolia autonomous region, was expelled from the CPC for severe disciplinary violations. The investigation found that Wang accepted bribes, including housing and banquet services, from private business owners and used his position to benefit others in exchange for bribes.
He also failed to report issues truthfully during inquiries and exploited his position for personal gain. Wang's illegal assets have been confiscated, and his case has been transferred to prosecutors for review and indictment.

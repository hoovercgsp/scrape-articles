Title: Foreign minister kicks off year with cherished visit to Africa
Date: Jan 7, 2025

For the past 35 years, China's foreign ministers have started each annual round of overseas visits with a trip to Africa, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday, describing the practice as unwavering and unchanging.
China's top diplomat made the remarks as he arrived in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, to begin his annual New Year visit.
Wang described the annual visits as a fine tradition and distinctive feature of China's diplomacy as he met Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, Namibia's president-elect.
Wang's week-long Africa trip will also take him to the Republic of the Congo, Chad, and Nigeria.
By upholding the tradition, China hopes to show the world that, despite the changes in the international and regional landscape, it remains Africa's most trustworthy friend, its most reliable partner in pursuing development and vitalization, and its strongest supporter on the international stage, he said.
Wang noted that China cherishes the friendship with the continent, because the two sides have always understood, trusted, supported, and helped each other in pursuing national independence and liberation, as well as in seeking common development.
China has elevated its relations with all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic ties to the strategic level, and the overall characterization of China-Africa relations has been elevated to an all-weather community with a shared future for the new era.
This highlights the need for China and Africa to firmly stand together and to further deepen cooperation, he said.
Strengthening solidarity and cooperation and jointly safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries serve the common aspiration of the 2.8 billion people from both sides, he added.

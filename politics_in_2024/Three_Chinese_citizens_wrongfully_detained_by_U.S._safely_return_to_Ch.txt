Date: Nov 28, 2024

In response to a question on reports that China and the U.S. have mutually released several individuals who were serving sentences, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday that with the persistent efforts of the Chinese government, the three Chinese citizens, who were wrongfully detained by the U.S., have safely returned to their homeland.
"This once again proves that China will never abandon its citizens. China will always be their strong support," Mao said at a routine press briefing.
Mao emphasized that China has always firmly opposed the U.S. government's political persecution of Chinese citizens, and will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.
Mao also noted that a fugitive who had been on the run in the U.S. for many years has been sent back to China. "This shows that no one can escape justice forever and there is no safe haven."
The Chinese government will continue its efforts to pursue fugitives and recover stolen assets, and will never stop until fugitives are brought to justice, said Mao.

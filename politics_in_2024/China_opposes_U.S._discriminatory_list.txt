Title: China opposes U.S. discriminatory list
Date: Jan 8, 2025

China is firmly opposed to the U.S. making discriminatory lists in various names and going after Chinese companies to contain China's high-quality development, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun has said.
Guo made the remarks at a regular news conference, after the U.S. Department of Defense added the Chinese companies Tencent and CATL to a list of companies it alleges work with China's military.
"The Chinese people must not be deprived of the right to development. And this right must not be ignored," Guo said, urging the U.S. to lift its illegal and unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies.
"China will take necessary measures to safeguard the lawful rights of Chinese companies and the country's legitimate right to development," the spokesman said.
Guo's remarks came on the same day Vice-Premier He Lifeng held talks via video links with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, where both sides agreed to maintain communication, manage differences and continue to stabilize bilateral economic relations during the transition period.

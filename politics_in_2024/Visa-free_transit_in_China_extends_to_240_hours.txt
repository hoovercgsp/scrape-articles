Title: Visa-free transit in China extends to 240 hours
Date: Dec 17, 2024

(ECNS) -- Chinaâ€™s National Immigration Administration (NIA) announced on Tuesday that starting from this day, the permitted stay for foreign nationals has been extended from the original 72 hours and 144 hours to 240 hours (10 days) under the new visa-free transit policy.
Additionally, 21 more ports of entry have been added to the list for visa-free transit passengers, while the areas where they can stay have been further expanded, according to NIA.
Citizens from 54 eligible countries, including Russia, Brazil, the U.K., the U.S., and Canada, can now transit through China en route to a third country (or region), and enter China visa-free through any of the 60 open ports of entry across 24 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). They can stay within the designated areas for up to 240 hours.
Compared to the previous 72/144-hour visa-free transit period, the new policy allows for cross-regional travel, meaning that foreign nationals can now travel between provinces within the designated areas during their stay.

Date: Dec 13, 2024

China firmly opposes any official exchanges or the establishment of official institutions between the authorities of island of Taiwan and Somaliland; and China urges relevant parties in Somalia to recognize the broader trend and uphold the one-China principle, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to an official from Taiwan region attending the inauguration ceremony of the "president-elect" of Somaliland.
China highly appreciates the Somali government's adherence to the one-China principle and firmly supports Somalia in defending Somalia's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, said Mao Ning, the spokesperson.
Mao reiterated that there is only one China, and island of Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The one-China principle is a basic norm in international relations and a prevailing international consensus. Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party's attempts to pursue independence through external means to split the country are destined to fail.
According to Taiwan regional media, Francois Wu is vising Somaliland and attending the inauguration ceremony of the "president-elect" of Somaliland, as special envoy of Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te.

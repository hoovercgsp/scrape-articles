Title: Master's graduate with mental health challenges found after 13 years, investigation under way
Date: Dec 9, 2024

(ECNS) -- The story of a woman found after going missing for over a decade has drawn widespread attention in China. Identified as Bu, she was located in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, and was found to have two children.
Questions have emerged online about whether Bu, allegedly suffering from mental health challenges, was fully aware of her actions when she became pregnant and gave birth.
On Saturday, officials from the Women’s Federation of Jinzhong City told media outlet Beijing News that their agency has launched an investigation into the matter. Similarly, the Heshun County Women’s Federation confirmed their involvement and announced plans to release an official report.
13-Year disappearance
Bu, originally from Yuci District of Jinzhong City, reportedly disappeared after experiencing a mental health episode during her doctoral examinations over a decade ago, according to Zhu Yutang, a volunteer who helped locate her.
Zhu said Bu’s family claimed she had been suffering from a mental disorder. She was recently found in Heshun County living with a man surnamed Zhang, with whom she had two children. She is currently receiving treatment at the Shanxi Provincial Mental Health Center.
In November, a relative of Zhang contacted volunteer search groups for assistance, saying her aunt had been living with her uncle for years but had no information about her family background, so she wanted to help reconnect her aunt, who turned out to be Bu, with her long-lost relatives.
On Nov. 30, with assistance from volunteers and police, Bu was reunited with her family after 13 years. The reunion was hailed as a moment of joy, but scrutiny soon followed regarding the circumstances of her disappearance and life during the intervening years.
Questions of Consent and Accountability
Online critics have questioned the plausibility of Bu’s journey from Yuci to Heshun, a considerable distance for someone in her condition to travel unaided. Concerns have also been raised about the circumstances under which she gave birth to her children, now aged 12 and 8. Was her relationship with Zhang consensual, or was she exploited?
Notably, video footage shared by Zhu Yutang showed Bu recalling details of her past during a two-hour conversation, including her father’s name and her schoolteacher. This raised further questions about why it took 13 years to locate her despite her apparent ability to communicate.
Police statement and public outrage
Heshun County Police issued a preliminary statement on Dec. 3, describing Bu’s situation as one of “shelter” provided by Zhang. However, the use of the term “shelter” has been heavily criticized online, with many accusing the authorities of downplaying a potential case of abduction or exploitation.
As investigations continue, advocacy groups and the public alike are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the authorities to ensure justice for Bu and her family.

Title: Top legislature to hold annual session in March
Date: Dec 26, 2024

The 14th National People's Congress, China's top legislature, will hold its third annual session in Beijing on March 5, according to a decision made by the NPC Standing Committee on Wednesday.
The proposed agenda of the session includes reviewing work reports of the central government, NPC Standing Committee and the country's top judicial authorities, with deliberation of reports on the implementation of the 2024 national economic and social development plan, alongside a draft plan for 2025.
Lawmakers are also expected to examine the report on the implementation of central and local budgets for 2024 and review draft budgets for 2025.
In addition, the session will review a draft amendment to the Law on Deputies to the National People's Congress and to the Local People's Congresses at Various Levels, the agenda said.
Separately, the third session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body, has been suggested to begin in the capital on March 4.
The suggestion was recently passed by the Chairperson's Council meeting of the 14th CPPCC National Committee.
The two sessions, as China's biggest annual political event, usually start in Beijing in early March. National lawmakers and political advisers will gather in Beijing, not only to review important reports delivered by major authorities and related to the country's crucial economic and social issues, but also to participate in formulating or amending laws related to the people's interests and the nation's development.

Date: Dec 11, 2024

Describing the land border they share as a bond of friendship and a bridge of cooperation, Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for concerted efforts between China and Vietnam to create clear, stable, prosperous borders featuring lasting friendship.
Wang made the comments as he attended an event on Tuesday with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Vietnam Bui Thanh Son in Beijing, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the demarcation of the land boundary between China and Vietnam, and the 15th anniversary of the signing of three legal documents.
With a land border of approximately 1,450 kilometers, the two countries signed the Treaty on the Land Border Between China and Vietnam in 1999 after nine years of negotiations.
The three legal documents celebrated at the event were the protocol on border demarcation and marker planting, the agreement on border management regulations, and the land border port and management system agreement.
The two countries should enhance border governance effectiveness, and maintain a clear and stable boundary line as well as good order in border areas to forge a clear and stable border, Wang said.
He expressed the hope that China and Vietnam can continuously improve the layout of port channels and promote the connectivity of cross-border infrastructure, such as bridges and roads, to facilitate regional coordinated development.
Wang also called on Beijing and Hanoi to create a border of lasting friendship by encouraging local exchanges and cultural interactions, and by jointly safeguarding peace, stability, and development in the region.
Son said Vietnam is willing to work with China to strengthen infrastructure construction in border areas and deepen practical cooperation in realms including border trade and ports, to make positive contributions to pushing bilateral relations to a higher level.

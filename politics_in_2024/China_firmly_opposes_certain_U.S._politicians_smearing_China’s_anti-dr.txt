Date: Dec 18, 2024

In response to an inquiry regarding a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers proposing three bills aimed at addressing "China's role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis", Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said the Chinese side firmly opposes certain American politicians distorting facts, spreading false information, and smearing China's efforts in drug control.
The root cause of the drug crisis in the U.S. lies within the country itself, and the key to solving the problem is also in the hands of the U.S., Lin said.
Some American politicians are advised to face up to the issues within the U.S., adopt more substantial measures to strengthen domestic regulations, and reduce domestic demand, rather than attempting to address internal problems by shifting blame and responsibility elsewhere, Lin added.
The proposed legislation includes the creation of a U.S. task force to combat narcotics trafficking and provisions that would enable sanctions against Chinese entities, the Voice of America reported.
Lin emphasized that China is among the most resolute countries in implementing anti-drug policies, with comprehensive measures and a strong track record. It is also one of the countries with the most controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world. China's anti-drug authorities have always strictly enforced the law to combat the loss of precursor chemicals and ensure that relevant enterprises operate legally and in compliance with regulations.
The Chinese side firmly opposes certain American politicians distorting facts, spreading false information, and smearing China's efforts in drug control, Lin added.

Date: Dec 13, 2024

Two former senior Chinese political advisers are facing serious corruption charges, with one admitting to accepting bribes and the other expelled from the Communist Party of China and public office amid allegations of abuse of power.
During a trial on Thursday at the Nanning Intermediate People's Court in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Han Yong, 67, admitted to accepting bribes totaling over 261 million yuan ($35.9 million).
Han, a former chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, was accused of misusing his positions from 1993 to 2023 to secure benefits for individuals and entities in exchange for illegal payments.
Prosecutors detailed how Han leveraged his influence in business operations, project contracting and personnel appointments.
Originally from Jilin province, Han's career spanned roles including deputy Party chief of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and general-procurator in Jilin province. He served in senior CPPCC roles until his retirement last year, when he was investigated in October.
During the trial, Han expressed guilt and remorse. The court has yet to announce his sentencing.
Separately, Gou Zhongwen, a former member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, was expelled from the Party and dismissed from public office following an investigation by China's top anti-corruption watchdog.
Gou, who previously led the General Administration of Sport of China, was found to have violated the Party's frugality rules by accepting gifts, attending banned banquets and participating in prohibited tourist activities.
Investigators also accused him of trading power for sex and money, unlawfully possessing classified documents and abusing his power, leading to significant economic losses.
A statement released Thursday said Gou's actions constituted serious violations of Party discipline and laws, and he is suspected of bribery and abuse of power.
Authorities have confiscated his illegal gains, and his case has been transferred to prosecutors for review and potential charges.

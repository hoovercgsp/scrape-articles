(ECNS) -- Three giant panda cubs born at animal park Pairi Daiza in Belgium, "Tian Bao," "Bao Di," and "Bao Mei," have safely returned to China, marking an important milestone in the panda conservation program between the two countries.
"Tian Bao," a male born on June 2, 2016, and twin siblings "Bao Di" and "Bao Mei," born on August 8, 2019, were accompanied by a team of experts from both countries during their journey to Chengdu, Sichuan Province.
To ensure the cubs’ safe return, Chinese specialists traveled to Belgium beforehand to familiarize themselves with the cubs’ habits and collaborate with Belgian experts on the pandas’ health assessments, behavioral training, and routine care.

Date: Nov 17, 2024

Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Saturday that the Thucydides's Trap is not a historical inevitability.
It is important to have a correct strategic perception, Xi said when meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the 31st APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Lima, Peru.
A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won, he said, adding that containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail.

Title: New Beijing-Yuxian expressway diverts traffic to protect 300-year-old ancient trees
Date: Dec 30, 2024

(ECNS) -- The Beijing-Yuxian Expressway, a vital new route connecting Beijing’s western region to Hebei Province, officially opened on Wednesday. The new expressway cuts travel time from Beijing’s Sixth Ring Road to Yuxian County from three hours to under two, with Zhuolu County, now reachable within an hour.
In a remarkable display of ecological sensitivity, the construction of the expressway was adjusted to protect a grove of ancient trees, some over 300 years old. To preserve this natural heritage, engineers shifted the road 100 meters northward and built a 290-meter "micro-tunnel" beneath the grove, ensuring minimal disruption to its environment.
The expressway's construction posed significant challenges due to its location within Beijing's ecological conservation area and Class I forest lands. To minimize environmental impact, the project team adopted innovative techniques, particularly in sensitive areas like the Baihuashan Nature Reserve.
One notable example is the Xiaolongmen Tunnel, located in a region with abundant wildlife and strict environmental regulations. Traditional construction methods proved inadequate, leading to prolonged work that was completed in October 2024.
However, an even more extraordinary adaptation took place near Qijiazhuang Village in Mentougou District. During preliminary work, engineers discovered a grove of 61 Chinese junipers, including 37 trees classified as ancient under national standards. Among these, nine were designated as first-class ancient trees, and 28 as second-class.
To protect this valuable grove, the construction team revised the original plans and designed the Qijiazhuang Tunnel. This 290-meter structure replaced a planned road section, preserving the ancient trees by tunneling beneath them.
The project also pioneered two patented methods to safeguard the trees: a basin-shaped protective structure isolating the root system from tunnel operations and a funnel-shaped design to ensure water retention and natural hydration.
Today, travelers on the Beijing-Yuxian Expressway can catch a glimpse of the ancient juniper grove as they pass through the Qijiazhuang Tunnel. The trees, standing proudly above the tunnel, form a striking natural landmark. Ongoing monitoring has confirmed that the grove remains healthy, with no adverse effects from the expressway’s construction.

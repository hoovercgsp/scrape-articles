Title: China is willing to work with Australia to properly address concerns through dialogue
Date: Dec 3, 2024

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that China is willing to work with Australia to continue to properly address each other's concerns through dialogue and consultation and to make China-Australia relations more mature and stable, and better benefit the peoples of both countries.
The remarks were made in response to a media question regarding reports in which the Australian Prime Minister said that China has lifted restrictions on Australia's meat exports, which could pave the way for more beef exports to China.
China has now lifted all restrictions on exports from Australian meat works, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, marking a new milestone in warming relations between the two governments, Bloomberg reported.

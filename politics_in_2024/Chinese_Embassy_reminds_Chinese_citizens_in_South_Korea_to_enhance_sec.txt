Date: Dec 4, 2024

The Chinese Embassy in South Korea has reminded Chinese citizens in the country to remain calm, pay attention to changes in the political situation, enhance security awareness, reduce unnecessary outings, be cautious in expressing political opinions, and comply with the official orders issued by the South Korean government. This advisory came after South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law on Tuesday evening.
The martial law commander issued a proclamation, banning all political activities, while also stating that the daily lives of ordinary citizens would be safeguarded to the greatest extent possible.
According to Yonhap News Agency,South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law on Tuesday, accusing the opposition of "anti-state activities plotting rebellion."
This decision came after the opposition Democratic Party railroaded a downsized budget bill in the parliamentary budget committee, and submitted impeachment motions against a state auditor and the chief prosecutor,according to the report.
The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) called in its lawmakers urgently to the National Assembly late Tuesday after President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law, according to Yonhap news.
DP leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon's declaration of emergency martial law "unconstitutional," condemning it as a move that "goes against the people." "President Yoon declared emergency martial law for no reason," Lee said.

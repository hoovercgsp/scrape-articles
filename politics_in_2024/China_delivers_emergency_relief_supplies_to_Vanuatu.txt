China has delivered 35 tons of emergency relief supplies to Vanuatu in its efforts to assist the island country to alleviate difficulties caused by a recent earthquake.
The supplies, which include tents, folding beds, food, water purifiers and medical equipment, arrived in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila on Thursday, according to the Chinese Embassy in Vanuatu.
Li Minggang, Chinese Ambassador to Vanuatu, said at the handover ceremony that China feels for the damage caused by the recent earthquake.
China is willing to continue providing assistance within its capacity for post-disaster reconstruction in Vanuatu, Li said.
Vanuatu's caretaker Prime Minister Charlot Salwai expressed appreciation for China's assistance, saying that the Vanuatu government will ensure that the aid reaches affected people as soon as possible.
A 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck Port Vila on Dec. 17, killing at least 14 people, injuring more than 200 and severely damaging the city's infrastructure.

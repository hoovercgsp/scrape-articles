HONOLULU, the United States, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Zhang Ping has called for concerted efforts to develop strong people-to-people bonds between China and the United States, stressing that Hawaii can play an important role in this regard.
Zhang made the remarks on Sunday at a ceremony marking the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was organized by local Chinese communities. He said the Aloha state has a unique position in terms of geographical location and cultural exchanges between the two countries and has close ties with China in many areas.
"As a meeting point of Eastern and Western cultures and a bond of friendship between Chinese and American people, it should play the role of a bridge connecting the two countries and two peoples," Zhang said.
According to him, China is Hawaii's fourth largest import market, fourth largest services export market and 10th largest goods export market.
The Chinese community in Hawaii, as an important part of the social fabric in Hawaii for generations, can play a more active role in promoting exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States in the future, Zhang said.
"Hawaii residents have celebrated the cultural connection we have with China and the economic connection with China," said Hawaii Lieutenant Governor Josh Green, who also attended the ceremony.
"We've had an extremely positive relationship," Green said. "We've always enjoyed it and treasured our relationship with the Chinese people in the business community." â–

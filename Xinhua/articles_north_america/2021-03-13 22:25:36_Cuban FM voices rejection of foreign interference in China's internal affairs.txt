HAVANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba rejects foreign interference in China's internal affairs, particularly regarding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has said.
The HKSAR is an inseparable part of China's territory, whose institutionality and legality have been guaranteed thanks to the one-China principle, Rodriguez tweeted Thursday.
China's top legislature Thursday adopted a decision on improving the electoral system of the HKSAR, unveiling a series of measures that will reform how the region's chief executive and local lawmakers are elected to ensure the financial hub is run by patriots. Enditem

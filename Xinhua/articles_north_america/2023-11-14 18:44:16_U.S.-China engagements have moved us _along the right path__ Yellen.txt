SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday that recent U.S.-China engagements have moved the two sides "along the right path."
"Responsibly managing the U.S.-China economic relationship" has been "a key priority" throughout her time in San Francisco, Yellen told reporters at a press conference following the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers' Meeting.
Yellen noted that she met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng last week, and had a "productive meeting" with China's new Finance Minister Lan Fo'an this week. â–

HAVANA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese community in Cuba celebrated the Lunar New Year on Monday abiding by COVID-19 safety protocols.
In Havana's Chinatown, streets and businesses along the road were adorned with red lanterns, one of the most famous decorations used by the Chinese in festivals that symbolize a prosperous business and a thriving life.
Images of martial arts performances by instructors and students from the Cuban School of Wushu and Qigong were also displayed on big screens installed in the iconic San Fan Con plaza.
Roberto Vargas Lee, the president of the school, told Xinhua that the Chinese community in Cuba would keep united during the Year of the Tiger.
"China inspires us to continue working hard for a better future," he said. "The Spring Festival is a clear expression of the richness and diversity of Chinese culture."
The celebration, which was held online last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, also included traditional lion dance performance.
"With these artworks, we want to express the strength of Chinese culture, traditions and customs," said Cuban painter Alexis Gonzalez. â–

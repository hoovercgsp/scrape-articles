BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's Congress (NPC) firmly opposes and strongly condemns the passage and signing into law of the so-called "Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act" by the United States, said a statement issued by the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Saturday.
The act grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and severely undermines China's interests, sending a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces seeking "Tibet independence," the statement said.  â–

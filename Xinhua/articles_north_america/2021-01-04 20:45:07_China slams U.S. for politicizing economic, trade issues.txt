BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes the United States' acts of politicizing economic and trade issues and abusing its state power and the concept of national security to groundlessly suppress Chinese companies, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Monday.
Hua made the remarks at a daily news briefing when asked to comment on an announcement of the New York Stock Exchange to delist three Chinese telecommunications companies under a U.S. government order.
"Such acts have seriously breached the U.S. much-touted principles of market economy and fair competition, as well as international economic and trade rules," she said.
Some political forces in the United States have continuously suppressed foreign listed companies for no reason, which reflects the arbitrariness and uncertainty of its systems and rules, Hua said, calling such acts "very unwise."
The acts will not only harm the interests of investors from various countries, but also damage the national interests and image of the United States, and the global status of the U.S. capital market, because such a status was based on the confidence of global investors and enterprises in the inclusiveness and certainty of its rules and systems, she said.
"We hope the U.S. side will respect the market and the rule of law, and do more to maintain the order of the global financial market, protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors, and contribute to the stable development of the global economy," said Hua.
The Chinese government will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, she said. Enditem

BEIJING, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- China resolutely opposes the United States' abuse of export control measures to restrict the export of semiconductor-related items to China, the country's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.
Shu Jueting, a spokesperson with the ministry, made the statements at a press briefing in response to questions regarding the U.S. government's recent restriction on U.S. chip designer Nvidia's exports of A100 and H100 chips to China.
Shu said such a move runs counter to the fair competition principle and violates international economic and trade rules.
It will harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and the interests of U.S. companies, said the spokesperson.
"The move will hamper international technological exchanges as well as economic and trade cooperation, and have a serious impact on the stability of global industrial and supply chains and global economic recovery," Shu said.
The U.S. side should stop its erroneous practices immediately, provide a level playing field for Chinese and other foreign companies, and do more things conducive to global economic stability, Shu added. â–

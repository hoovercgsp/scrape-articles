BEIJING, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States should strengthen dialogue and communication to advance the healthy and steady development of bilateral ties, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Tuesday.

Wang called on the two sides to uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation and manage differences, so as to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral ties. Enditem

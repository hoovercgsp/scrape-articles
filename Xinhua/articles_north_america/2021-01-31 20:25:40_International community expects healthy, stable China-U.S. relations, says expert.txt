TASHKENT, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The international community is calling for a healthy and stable China-U.S. relationship, an Uzbek political expert said Sunday.
Cooperation is better than disagreement and dialogue is better than confrontation in China-U.S. relations, and this is in the fundamental interest of the world community, Shoazim Shozamonov, a Sinology professor at the Tashkent State University of Oriental Studies, told Xinhua.
"There are indeed many differences between China and the United States, but this does not mean that there is no place for cooperation," Shozamonov said.
In the spirit of finding common ground while maintaining differences, the two countries should take maximum care of each other's needs and problems, increase dialogue, and bolster mutually beneficial cooperation, he said. Enditem

NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A tidal wave of Chinese firms have been rushing into the initial public offering (IPO) market in the United States in recent months, U.S. media has reported.
Citing consulting firm Ernst & Young (EY), a report of U.S. media outlet CNBC said Tuesday that the first three months of 2021 "marked the busiest quarter" for overall U.S. IPOs since 2000.
"Half of 36 foreign public listings in the U.S. during that time came from companies based in Greater China," the report cited EY as saying.
Roughly 60 Chinese firms plan to go public in the U.S. IPO market in 2021, Vera Yang, chief China representative for the New York Stock Exchange, was cited by the article.
According to Yang, the rush occurring now is related to a few factors, including uncertainties created by COVID-19, as well as "a likely tightening of monetary policy in the longer term that would reduce the availability of capital." Enditem

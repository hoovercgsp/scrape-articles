BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada should offer China a clear explanation as soon as possible over the malicious customized shirts of its diplomatic staff, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Wednesday.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks at a press briefing after a Canadian foreign ministry spokesperson claimed the customized shirts with the "bat" pattern and "WUHAN" lettering were nothing more than a "misunderstanding."
Wang said Canada's claims of a "misunderstanding" are unconvincing, stressing that some mainstream Canadian media also admitted that the shirts are printed with bat-like patterns.
"We can hardly believe that the individual concerned, as a high-level diplomat who has worked and lived in China for many years, would make such a low-level mistake unconsciously," said Wang.
Noting the actions of the relevant Canadian personnel have aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Chinese people, Wang said Canada should take this matter seriously and give China a clear explanation as soon as possible. Enditem

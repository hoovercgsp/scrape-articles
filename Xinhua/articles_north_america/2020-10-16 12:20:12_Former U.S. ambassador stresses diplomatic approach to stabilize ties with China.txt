NEW YORK, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- It is crucial for the United States to develop a positive relationship with China, and the diplomatic approach is preferable during that process, former U.S. ambassador to China Stapleton Roy said Thursday.
"Having a workable relationship with China is more important now than ever before," Roy said at a virtual panel discussion on U.S.-China relations hosted by China Institute, a New York City-based think tank.
"We need a better way of managing the bilateral relationship than what we have at the moment," he said, noting that diplomacy is vital to forging ahead U.S.-China ties.
"Diplomacy is much more effective" in fostering constructive relations, he added.
Noting that the United States and China are the two most consequential countries in the world, Roy said that a stable bilateral relationship serves the interests of both sides. Enditem

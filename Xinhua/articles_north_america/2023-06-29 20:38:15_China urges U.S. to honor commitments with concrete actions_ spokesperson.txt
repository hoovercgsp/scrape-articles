BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China urges the U.S. to stop making irresponsible comments and honor its commitments with concrete actions, a Chinese spokesperson said on Thursday.
Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the remarks in response to a media report. According to the report, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a recent interview that it is no secret that there are differences between the U.S. and China. The U.S. will continue to stand for its interests, stand up for its values and continue to do things and say things that China doesn't like.
Mao said China is dissatisfied with the comments made by Secretary Blinken.
She said the U.S. pursues a misconceived China policy which stems from a misguided China perception, seeks to block, contain and suppress China and has been attacking and smearing China's image to interfere in China's internal affairs.
What the U.S. has said and done violates the basic norms governing international relations. China has every reason to firmly oppose that, said the spokesperson.
"I would like to stress again that mutual respect is the basic principle for countries dealing with each other and an essential ingredient for China and the U.S. to find the right way to get along," Mao said, adding that China urges the U.S. to stop making irresponsible comments and honor its commitments with concrete actions. â–

BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes the United States' groundless suppression of Chinese enterprises, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Friday, slamming the U.S. Department of Defense which designated four more firms as "controlled by China's military."
The companies in question are China Construction Technology Consulting Co., Ltd. (CCTC), China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).
China firmly opposes this groundless suppression and has made its solemn position clear on many occasions, Hua said at a press briefing.
What the United States has done seriously violates market competition principles and the international economic and trade rules, and will seriously harm its national interests and image, she said.
Hua said Chinese enterprises always operate in accordance with laws and regulations, and strictly abide by the laws and regulations of the host countries of their international operations.
The United States should stop abusing state power and generalizing the concept of national security to suppress foreign enterprises, she said. Enditem

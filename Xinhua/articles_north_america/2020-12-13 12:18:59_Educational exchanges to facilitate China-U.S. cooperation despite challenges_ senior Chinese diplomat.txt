WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Education exchanges will remain an essential impetus for China-U.S. mutually beneficial cooperation in the future, even though some U.S. politicians' Cold War mentality and ideological bias have pushed the bilateral ties to the edge, a senior Chinese diplomat has said.
Yang Xinyu, minister counselor for educational affairs at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, made the remarks when Julia Chang Bloch, president of the D.C.-based nonprofit U.S.-China Education Trust, asked if she sees hope for international education between China and the United States to return to normal in 2021.
"I always believe that trust can be built through education and culture," Yang said in their recent conversation.
"Last year was the 40th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations. We also celebrated 40 years of China-U.S. student exchange. 40 years have proved that educational exchanges benefit China and the U.S. at the same time," she said.
Calling educational exchanges "the fundamental power of the over-all relations between the two countries," Yang said cooperation is the only option for the prosperity of both countries and for addressing common challenges to all mankind.
"And student exchange will, as always, facilitate such cooperation," she added. Enditem

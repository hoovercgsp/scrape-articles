BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes the continued spread of ungrounded false information by the United States about Russia's so-called "defense industrial base fueled by China," foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Thursday.
Lin's remarks came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's accusation at the 2024 NATO Public Forum.
"We express strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the erroneous remarks made by the U.S. side," Lin told a daily press briefing. â–

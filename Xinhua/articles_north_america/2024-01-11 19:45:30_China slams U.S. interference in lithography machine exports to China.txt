BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday blasted the United States for directly interfering in and disturbing the export of lithography machines by Dutch companies to China.
"The U.S. side has instrumentalized and weaponized export controls and even bluntly intervened in normal trade between enterprises in other countries, which China firmly opposes," said Shu Jueting, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce.
"We urge the Dutch side to respect the spirit of contracts, support enterprises in conducting trade in compliance with regulations, and maintain a free, open, just and non-discriminatory international trade environment," she said at a press conference.
"China will closely follow the development and impact of the issue and take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies," Shu added. â–

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States needs to have a rational view of its relationship with China, a renowned scholar said Thursday.
"Let's have win-win competition, let there be competition, but let that competition be framed by fair and equitable rules," Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, told Xinhua in an interview.
"Bashing China is not going to help the United States, because what it does distracts the U.S. from doing what it needs to do to be able to compete with China," Gupta said.
"China is not containable. You need to find ways in which you can compete with China on a fair and even platform. And the Chinese are ready and willing to do this," said Gupta.
"The U.S. must give up this attitude that 'it's our way or the highway' ... (that) we will only dictate to others the way they must follow the U.S. rules," he said. "That is not acceptable."
"There needs to be give-and-take and fairness in negotiations and outcomes," he added. Enditem

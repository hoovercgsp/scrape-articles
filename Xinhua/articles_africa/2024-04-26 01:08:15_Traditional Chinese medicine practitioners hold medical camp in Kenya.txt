NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya on Thursday hosted prominent traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners from southwest China's Sichuan Province, who offered a range of medical services to Chinese nationals living in the East African country.
The six Chinese doctors specialize in diverse fields, including dermatology, orthopedics, endocrinology, cervical spondylopathy, and age-related ailments.
Hosted by the Kenya Sichuan-Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce and the China General Chamber of Commerce in East Africa, the event offered acupuncture and cupping therapy during the free clinic in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.
The Chinese nationals living in Kenya and some local citizens attended the medical camp, demonstrating the growing recognition of TCM in mainstream health care.
Judy Wanjiru, a construction industry practitioner who studied environmental engineering in China, said she is familiar with TCM, which she believes is both safe and effective in treating ailments.
She asked local citizens to embrace TCM because it has the potential to help the country reduce its high burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases.
As part of their overseas trip, the TCM practitioners offered diagnosis and treatment services and explained their benefits to some local citizens.
It is hoped that their trip will help promote TCM culture in Africa and ensure that it is embraced by a critical mass of people on the continent and around the world, said Xu Houping, vice president of the Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southwest Medical University. â–

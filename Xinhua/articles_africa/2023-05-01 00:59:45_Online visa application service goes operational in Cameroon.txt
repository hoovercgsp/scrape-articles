YAOUNDE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Online visa application service went operational in Cameroon on Sunday, according to the country's Ministry of External Relations.
The new digital system will replace the manual system and is expected to reduce the government's investment in money, time, paperwork, and manpower allocated to visa applications while also better serving its visitors, said Minister of External Relations, Lejeune Mbella Mbella.
"The new system puts an end to long queues and has enormous benefits for applicants," Mbella said while officially launching the platform in the capital, Yaounde.
According to the ministry, the application will be carried out "exclusively" through a dedicated website, www.evisacam.cm, after which an online visa authorization will be issued to the applicant who can then go to either a diplomatic mission or a border post to actually obtain the visa.
For applicants in areas far-flung from a diplomatic mission or those not covered by a mission, an online visa authorization, together with a QR code, shall round off the phase.
The procedure will be completed within 72 hours from the date of pre-enrollment, or 24 hours in the case of express visa applications. â–

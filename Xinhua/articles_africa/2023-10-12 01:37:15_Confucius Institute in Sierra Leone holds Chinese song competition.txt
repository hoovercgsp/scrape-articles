FREETOWN, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Confucius Institute at the University of Sierra Leone hosted its 5th Chinese song competition in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, on Wednesday, which aimed to provide Chinese learners in the West African country with a better understanding of Chinese culture.
Elizabeth Kamar, a university student, emerged as the winner of the fierce competition, which had a total of 15 contestants. In an interview after the contest, Kamar expressed her appreciation to the Confucius Institute for its support during the training for the competition.

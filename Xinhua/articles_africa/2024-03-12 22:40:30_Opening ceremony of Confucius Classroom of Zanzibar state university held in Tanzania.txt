ZANZIBAR, Tanzania, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of the Confucius Classroom at the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) was held Monday in Tanzania's Zanzibar, which will offer a good opportunity for Zanzibaris to learn the Chinese language and culture.
Unveiling the Confucius Classroom at the SUZA, Zanzibari Minister for Education and Vocational Training Lela Mohamed Mussa said Chinese language education will play a great role in promoting friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Tanzania.
The minister said that from 2022 to 2023, the Confucius Classroom at the SUZA held various kinds of traditional Chinese holiday celebrations and Chinese cultural activities.
Mohamed Makame Haji, vice chancellor of the SUZA, said the Confucius Classroom at the SUZA has begun to solve the long-standing problem of the communication and language barrier that has hindered the economic progress of Zanzibaris working or doing business in China for quite some time.
He urged government officials, school owners, and members of the business community to take time to learn the Chinese language and culture to better prepare for the challenges of the 21st century.
Haji said the SUZA will continue to strengthen cooperation with east China's Zhejiang Normal University and Chinese partners for the benefit of all people in Zanzibar and China.
Zhang Ming, acting consul general of the Chinese Consulate General in Zanzibar, said the establishment of the Confucius Classroom is not only a symbol of the friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Tanzania but also provides a valuable opportunity for the local people to understand the Chinese language and culture.
"It also provides the Chinese people with an in-depth understanding of Zanzibar," said Zhang, adding that customs and sentiments build bridges. â–

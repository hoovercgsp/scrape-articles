NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Strong winds from Tropical Cyclone Ialy have hit various parts of the Kenyan coast, resulting in destruction of property, the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) said on Tuesday.
The KRCS said in a statement that the extreme winds blew off roofs of residential areas and toppled electric poles in some areas. Its rescue team noted that despite the destruction caused by the strong winds, no casualties were reported in coastal areas.
The charity said the winds caused destruction in Casuarina, Olimpia, Madunguni of Malindi County, and those located in Garashi of Kilifi County, leading to a major blackout.
The Kenya Meteorological Department warned of potential destruction to marine activities caused by Tropical Cyclone Ialy. It also said Ialy is expected to weaken on Wednesday while bringing rain, storms, and winds to the coastal areas.
Heavy rains and flash floods continue to cause damage and displacement across Kenya, with 291 people killed, 188 injured, and 75 missing, while 278,380 people are estimated to have been displaced and more than 412,760 affected by heavy rains and flooding between March and May 16, according to government statistics. â–

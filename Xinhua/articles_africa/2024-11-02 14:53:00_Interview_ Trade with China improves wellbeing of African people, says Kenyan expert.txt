NAIROBI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Surging trade with China over the past 15 years has served as a catalyst for job creation and an uplift in living standards across the African continent, a Kenyan economist told Xinhua.
In an interview with Xinhua, Professor Xn Iraki from the University of Nairobi underscored the critical role of balanced trade as a foundation for a win-win scenario, propelling rapid development in Africa and China.
Iraki shed light on the significance of dialogue platforms between China and African nations, notably Kenya, such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, highlighting their role as essential conduits for aligning mutual interests, overcoming trade challenges, and seizing untapped opportunities.
He encouraged open discourse among trading entities to foster deeper commercial ties and explore new frontiers in trade, despite the geographical distance between China and Africa.
Iraki highlighted China's commitment to delivering top-tier products at competitive prices, without tariff barriers, which is instrumental in cultivating a more transparent and balanced trade ecosystem.
Reflecting on the historical shift in global trade, Iraki applauded China's burgeoning presence. He projected a promising trajectory for Kenya-China trade hinged on Kenya's embrace of Chinese products and services, and China's dedication to quality and affordability.
Regarding investment, Iraki said China's status as the "workshop of the world" has naturally attracted foreign investment, which is bolstered by its efficient systems and supply chains.
On China's assistance to Africa, the Kenyan expert highlighted its unconditional and visible nature, which is often manifested in infrastructure projects like roads and ports, as opposed to the conditional aid from some Western countries. â–

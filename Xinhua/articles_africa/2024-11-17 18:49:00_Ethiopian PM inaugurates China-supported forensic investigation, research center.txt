ADDIS ABABA, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed inaugurated the Ethiopian Federal Police Forensic Investigation and Research Center of Excellence Saturday in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
Speaking at the event, Abiy said the center would help members of the federal police conduct digital forensic investigation and DNA testing as well as analyze complex crimes.
"Just a year and a half ago, when DNA testing was needed, we had to rely on external resources," the prime minister noted on his social media page after inaugurating the center.
Abiy said the center is the outcome of the government's commitment to modernizing law enforcement agencies and equipping them with the necessary technology and knowledge. He also underscored that the achievement reflects the significant reforms the East African country has undertaken in the security and safety sector over the past five years.
"Today, Ethiopia has established an institution capable of addressing DNA-related challenges domestically while also serving neighboring countries," said the prime minister, recalling that the country had been sending samples to South Africa for DNA testing until very recently.
The inauguration event was attended by senior government officials, members of the federal police, and diplomats from various countries.
The Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia in its congratulatory message said the center would meet not only the needs of Ethiopia but also East African countries and that of the whole of Africa.
According to the Chinese Embassy, China provided technical and equipment support to the newly inaugurated forensic investigation and research center. â–

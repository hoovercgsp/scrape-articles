ACCRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Students learning the Chinese language at the University of Ghana resumed their annual week celebration Monday after a three-year hiatus due to COVID-19.
During a launching ceremony, Herbert Appiatu Danquah, president of the Chinese Students Association at the University of Ghana, told Xinhua that the celebration, now in its 14th year, will continue contributing to deepening the cultural relations between Ghana and China while igniting interest in the Chinese language among Ghanaians.
Danquah said the week-long activities would bring alumni of Chinese language studies, experts in Sino-African relations and individuals who have worked with the Chinese fraternity to address the students on Ghana-China relations.
"We believe that the engagements with the various alumni, other students, lectures and various experts, will go a long way to strengthen our mutual bond and create a further path for strengthening the relationship between Ghana and China," he said.
Prince Akantogdaam, a former president of the association, said he is glad that the celebrations return to the university, adding that students' craze for the Chinese language has grown fast in recent years.
"During my time, there were about 120 students in the whole class. But the following year, the number increased to about 300," Akantogdaam said, adding that the number of students learning Chinese in the university has reached about 1,000.
"The number keeps increasing, and interest in the Chinese language keeps growing," Akantogdaam said. â–

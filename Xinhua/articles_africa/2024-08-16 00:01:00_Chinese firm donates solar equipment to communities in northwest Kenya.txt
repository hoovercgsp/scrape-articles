BARINGO, Kenya, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chuanshan International Mining Company, a Chinese firm, on Thursday donated 160 solar panels and batteries to communities in northwest Kenya's Baringo County.
Han Ke, general manager of Chuanshan International, said that the donation will provide power to households that are not connected to the electricity grid.
"The solar panels will enable residents to use modern electronic devices at their homes," Han declared.
Johannes Ogola, the local administrator, said that the solar equipment donation is ideal because the remote region lacks access to electricity. Ogola noted that the solar equipment will also enable residents to take advantage of abundant sunshine throughout the year to power their homes.
Li Hong, deputy director-general of the Shandong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office, said that the donation is an act of kindness that will inject new meaning into the cooperation between Shandong Province and Baringo County and enhance mutual understanding among the two peoples.
Li added that the Shandong Provincial Government, in collaboration with Afridge Development Plan and Chuanshan International Mining Company, has decided to donate a batch of solar power generation equipment to the people of Baringo to enable the local community to access lightning.
Henry Kemtut, a 40-year-old resident who was a beneficiary, said that the solar products will enable his household of four to watch television and charge their mobile phones. â–

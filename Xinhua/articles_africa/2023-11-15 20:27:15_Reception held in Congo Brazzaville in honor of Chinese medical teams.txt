BRAZZAVILLE, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the Republic of the Congo Li Yan chaired a reception in honor of the 29th and 30th Chinese medical teams to Congo on Tuesday evening at the embassy.
This 30th team is made up, like the outgoing 29th, of 30 doctors. They include ophthalmologists, surgeons, radiologists and specialists in traditional Chinese medicine.
"Congo is of particular importance to the Chinese medical mission sent to Africa. For nearly six decades, despite international vagaries, Chinese doctors have remained faithful to their initial commitment, namely to overcome various difficulties and demonstrate international humanism," Li said.
Anselme Ludovic Gnekoumou Libaba, technical adviser to the Congolese minister of health, attended the reception.
Since 1967, which marked the beginning of the Chinese medical mission in Congo, nearly 1,000 Chinese medical professionals have set foot on Congolese soil, benefiting nearly 5 million Congolese patients. â–

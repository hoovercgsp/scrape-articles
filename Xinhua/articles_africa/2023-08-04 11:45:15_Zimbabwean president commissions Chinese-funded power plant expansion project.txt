HWANGE, Zimbabwe, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Thursday commissioned the Chinese-funded Hwange Thermal Power Station expansion project in Hwange, about 780 km from the capital Harare.
Chinese firm Sinohydro undertook the expansion, adding two new generators, Unit 7 and Unit 8, to the existing six units at the power plant.
Unit 7 is already feeding into the grid after the successful completion of tests in June while Unit 8 is undergoing tests and is expected to be available commercially soon.
The completion of the landmark project is a result of the fruitful cooperation between China and Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa said after touring the facility.
The president expressed gratitude to China for its efforts in supporting Zimbabwe's infrastructure development.
Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the completion of the project marks a significant milestone in China-Zimbabwe relations.
"This landmark project will not only provide Zimbabwe with reliable power supply and brighten up millions of Zimbabwean households but also inject new vitality into the country's socio-economic progress," he said. â–

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said on Thursday that the government encourages Chinese companies to explore new investment potential in Africa in such areas as digital economy and green development, and to innovate the investment-construction-operation model.
Responding to a media enquiry on China's investment in Africa, MOC spokesperson He Yadong said at a press conference that the government encourages Chinese firms to expand economic and trade cooperation in Africa in accordance with commercial and market rules.

SHENZHEN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A new air freight route has officially opened between south China's metropolis of Shenzhen and Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The route is operated by Central Airlines six times a week, with a weekly transportation capacity in excess of 120 tonnes. Inbound freight is mainly seafood from Southeast Asia, but, according to the Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, inbound flights will also carry tropical fruits like durians and bananas in the future. Outbound cargo is mainly e-commerce goods such as electronic products and clothes.
Indonesia is Southeast Asia's most populous country and biggest economy, and its capital is the biggest city in Southeast Asia. In 2022, trade between Indonesia and China increased by nearly 20 percent from the previous year. China remained Indonesia's largest trading partner and largest export market.
China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) became each other's largest trading partners in 2020. China's imports from and exports to ASEAN amounted to 6.52 trillion yuan (about 937 billion U.S. dollars) in 2022. Trade between China and ASEAN is expected to increase further with the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, the world's biggest free trade pact.
Shenzhen now handles nearly 100 cargo flights to and from ASEAN countries each week, which will promote the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area's trade with ASEAN and other RCEP members.
It will also facilitate the rapid delivery of fresh seafood and fruits from Southeast Asia to Shenzhen, bringing more food choices to locals. â–

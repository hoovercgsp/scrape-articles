NAIROBI, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese embassy on Tuesday invited Kenyan online content creators to visit China.
The embassy said in a notice that the content creators will visit several major cities, explore China's dynamic economy, rich culture, and fascinating history, and create content.
"We are inviting you to visit some major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing at the end of September and experience the real China firsthand," the embassy said.
Kenya and China enjoy bilateral relations that date back nearly 61 years when Beijing opened its embassy in Nairobi soon after the East African country gained independence.
Kenya is one of the countries in Africa with a vibrant online community where content creation is thriving.
Chinese social media platform TikTok is one of the most popular in Kenya, with the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2023 observing that 54 percent of Kenyans it sampled used TikTok, the highest proportion worldwide. â–

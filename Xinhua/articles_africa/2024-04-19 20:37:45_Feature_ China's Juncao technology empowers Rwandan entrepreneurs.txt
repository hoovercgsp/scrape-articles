KIGALI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- In the Kabuye district of Kigali, Rwanda's capital, a bustling mushroom workshop operates with precision. Two workers meticulously blended fungus grass powder, cottonseed hulls and water in the mixing machine, while another operated the bagging machine, ensuring that each culture tube was filled with the perfect mixture for mushroom cultivation.
"After sterilizing the tubes at high temperatures, we inoculate them with strains in a sterile environment. It takes about 35 days for the mycelium to grow all over the tubes, and then they are ready for planting," explained Leonidas Mushimiyimana, the workshop's owner.
Mushimiyimana, a 42-year-old father of two, recounted his journey from university graduation to entrepreneurship, driven by the desire for stable employment and the search for the right opportunity.
His breakthrough came in 2013, thanks to a collaborative effort between the Rwandan and Chinese governments. Through this partnership, Mushimiyimana received training in Juncao technology at southeast China's Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University.
Upon returning, Mushimiyimana established DEYI Ltd., launching his venture into mushroom production. Within two years, the enterprise expanded, leading to the establishment of the present workshop, supplying mushrooms to Kigali and exporting to neighboring countries such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Juncao, a hybrid grass cultivated through decades of Chinese scientific research, emerges as a multifunctional agricultural resource.
"Juncao is known as the 'happiness herb' in Rwanda," said Zheng Ruijin, an agricultural expert at the China-Rwanda Agriculture Technology Demonstration Center.
Beyond mushroom cultivation, its leaves, stems and roots find utility in ecological treatments, combating soil erosion and desertification while serving as fodder for livestock and poultry.
Since its inception in 2011, the center has supported over 50 enterprises and cooperatives involved in mushroom culture tubes in Rwanda. It has conducted 47 training courses, enlightening nearly 1,800 locals on Juncao technology.
Today, the technology benefits over 4,000 Rwandan farmers, catalyzing the creation of more than 30,000 jobs along the agricultural value chain.
Mushimiyimana credited Chinese agricultural experts for their technical support throughout the stages of his business. Now, his workshop employs 10 full-time workers, supplemented by 45 temporary hires during peak seasons.
"I have also hired 10 young people in different localities to collect and sell mushrooms and to further expand the market," Mushimiyimana said.
Mushimiyimana highlighted the affordability of the mushroom business, priced at just 500 Rwandan francs (about 39 U.S. cents) per tube, which yields a significant profit margin. This accessibility allows even housewives to start a business with minimal investment, using their earnings to cover living expenses and their children's education fees.
Nyambo Obed, a 34-year-old entrepreneur from Muhanga district, echoed Mushimiyimana's sentiments. Having delved into mushroom cultivation for more than five years, Obed employs 11 workers across workshops in Southern and Eastern provinces. He emphasized the industry's role in enhancing nutritional diversity and employment opportunities.
In June of the previous year, Obed traveled to China for Juncao technology training. Recollecting the experience with enthusiasm, he said, "In China, I visited some large enterprises in this area, which showed me that my dream is real. That motivated me to put more effort into this endeavor to create a larger company that can employ more people." â–

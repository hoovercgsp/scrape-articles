CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The remarkable development in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has significantly improved the living standards of the local residents, said an expert who visited the region in 2023.
"I was impressed by the economic development that has been taking place across China with no exception and no discrimination," Warda al-Husseni, managing editor of Egypt's state-run Akhbar El-Yom newspaper, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
As a member of a journalist delegation, al-Husseni visited several Chinese regions and provinces, including Xinjiang.
"Chinese development plans are inclusive, covering all areas across the country and leaving no city or region behind," al-Husseni said, expressing her admiration for the Chinese government's efforts to build a better and more prosperous future for its citizens.
"Living conditions in Xinjiang are steadily improving, and the local government and people are striving to achieve balanced development in many fields and create a prosperous life with concerted efforts," she said.
Noting that the Chinese government paid much attention to delivering the benefits of development to the local residents, she said that the people in Xinjiang, both the elderly and the young, were enjoying their lives.
"Every inch of the region reflects its history, including the Shaanxi Grand Mosque built in the Qing Dynasty in the capital city Urumqi, which we visited and is frequented by the citizens," she said.
Al-Husseni highlighted China's success in integrating different ethnic groups into one society while preserving their unique cultures. "China considers this diversity of people as a source of strength," she said.
She believed that Xinjiang's progress would significantly bolster cooperation under the Belt and Road given its geographic location and rich history in Silk Road trade.
Al-Husseni expressed hope that Egypt would benefit from bilateral cooperation with China. â–

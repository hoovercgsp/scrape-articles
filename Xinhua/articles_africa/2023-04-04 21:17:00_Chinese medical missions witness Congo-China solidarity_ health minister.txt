BRAZZAVILLE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese medical missions to the Republic of the Congo has witnessed the growing solidarity between the two countries, said Gilbert Mokoki, Congolese minister of Health and Population on Monday.
Mokoki made the remarks at the reception held by the Chinese Embassy in the country to celebrate the 60th anniversary of China dispatching its first medical aid team abroad.
China "has always marked its presence with the Republic of the Congo, even in the most worrying moments that have been ours," he noted, recalling that China was the first country to provide his country with medical assistance and vaccines right after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The presence of Chinese doctors also testifies to the closeness between the two peoples, said the Congolese minister, voicing his hope that more Congolese students could study medical skills in China and strengthen bilateral ties.
Chinese Ambassador to the Republic of the Congo Ma Fulin said for 60 years, the medical assistance missions to the African continent have reflected the fact that China stands side by side with African countries.
Bilateral cooperation has delivered fruitful outcomes in various fields, including the health sector, Ma said, noting that Chinese doctors stand out in the China-Congolese brotherhood with their professionalism.
Since 1967, China has sent 934 doctors in 29 batches to the Republic of the Congo. Chinese doctors have treated nearly 5 million patients and performed about 150,000 operations. â–

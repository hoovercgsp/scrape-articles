KIGALI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) is a people's party because it was created for the Chinese people, with the primary goal of improving their welfare, a Rwandan expert has said.
The Chinese people trust the CPC due to its track record of delivering visible improvements and tangible results in various aspects of governance, leading to increased well-being and happiness among the population, Joseph Mutaboba, a former United Nations envoy and a career diplomat, told Xinhua in Kigali in a recent interview.
"The CPC's historical intention was to enhance the well-being and livelihoods of the people of China. It was created for the people, as they sought to improve their way of life and establish a presence on the world stage," Mutaboba said.
"The theory and doctrine of socialism, which was already embraced by many, appealed to the Chinese people," the career diplomat said, adding that the CPC's appeal among the Chinese can be attributed to improved leadership, effective governance and economic development.
Describing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as a key aspiration and mission of the CPC, Mutaboba said China's decision to open up and embrace change has played a vital role in transforming it into a dynamic society.
"China's ability to feed its large population highlights the progress made in agriculture, ensuring food security. The country has made remarkable strides in modernizing agriculture, science and technology, defense, and industry, putting them on the right track for continued development," he said, citing advancements in such areas as 5G technologies and traditional Chinese medicine.
China's modernization is characterized by peaceful development, which recognizes the interconnectedness of peace and development, he said, adding that prioritizing peace and prosperity creates a solid foundation for sustainable development. â–

JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Homelife Trade Fair 2024 kicked off on Tuesday in Johannesburg, South Africa, featuring more than 400 companies showcasing their products and services to potential partners from various African countries.

"We have high expectations. Last year, deals worth 700 million U.S. dollars were signed at the show, and we expect this year's figure to surpass that," said Pillai, adding that the event offers a platform for Chinese enterprises and those from Africa to connect and conduct business.
Chinese exhibitors have brought a diverse range of high-quality products, including machinery, business materials, textiles and garments, power and energy solutions, households and gifts, office furniture, and more. Many are seeking to invest and form joint ventures with African partners, said Pillai.
Tiago De Freitas, sales executive at GWM Haval Hatfield, expressed enthusiasm about their first-time participation in China Homelife.
Many people gathered in the exhibit area, showing great interest in the Haval H6 GT, De Freitass said, adding that "people are even asking for a test drive. When they sit inside this car, they want to drive it. We are confident that several deals would be clinched by the end of the show."

The trade fair also featured a conference where experts from South Africa shared insights on collaborating effectively with Chinese companies. Representatives of Chinese manufacturers provided information about their products and services.

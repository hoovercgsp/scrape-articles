LILONGWE, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has donated 33 metric tonnes of maize flour, valued at 24,650 U.S. dollars, to food-insecure families in Lilongwe, Malawi's capital.
This donation on Thursday follows a similar donation of maize flour and red beans worth over 40,000 dollars made by China just two weeks earlier in the lakeshore Nkhotakota District.
Speaking at the donation ceremony, Wang Hao, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Malawi, highlighted the gesture as "another real reflection" of the two country's strong relationship.
"China is the true friend and sincere partner of African countries, including Malawi; the Chinese government and people feel the pain of our Malawian friends, and would like to play our part in addressing the food crisis," said Wang, adding that the donation reflects the Chinese proverb, "Timely help is like sending charcoal in snowy weather."
Accepting the donation, Malawi's Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs Charles Kalemba expressed gratitude for China's support, saying that China has consistently shown true friendship by providing crucial support during times of need.
Kalemba acknowledged China's ongoing assistance in promoting agricultural technology and irrigation, essential to Malawi's food sustainability.
According to a September 2024 report by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee, 5.7 million Malawians face food insecurity due to El Nino-related floods and drought during the 2023-2024 growing season. â–

BRAZZAVILLE, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso on Monday inaugurated the twin towers based in Mpila, a district in eastern Brazzaville, the Congolese capital.
For Jean-Jacques Bouya, the Congolese minister in charge of infrastructure, the twin towers, the construction of which was carried out by Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), a Chinese company, are "a strong signal for the development of tourism."
Dieudonne Bantsimba, the mayor of Brazzaville, welcomed the presence of these sumptuous buildings built on the shore of the Congo River. He then invited the Congolese people to take ownership of the two towers which, according to him, will contribute to the beautification of the Congolese capital.
Built on a land of 121,800 square meters, the 30-story, 135-meter-high twin towers will serve as a commercial center. One of the towers will be reserved for offices, while the other one houses a five-star hotel. The project, which mobilized about 800 Congolese and Chinese technicians for construction, is co-financed by Congo and the Export and Import Bank of China.
"I would like to congratulate the company managers, engineers and workers who created this magnificent work which symbolizes strength and beauty, and gives a very strong signal on the future of relations between China and Congo," declared the Congolese President during a visit to the site in September 2023. â–

DAR ES SALAAM, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Confucius Institute at the University of Dar es Salaam on Wednesday celebrated the Chinese Lunar New Year in style as students learning Mandarin danced, sang, and played kung fu.
The students and Chinese language teachers were joined by staff of the China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC) Tanzania Office which signed an agreement with the Confucius Institute in August 2023 aimed at enhancing cultural exchange and cooperation between China and Tanzania. The participants were treated to a luncheon hosted by the CCCC, featuring rich Chinese cuisine.
Pendo Malangwa, the acting deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Dar es Salaam, praised the Confucius Institute for being instrumental in offering cultural exchange and Chinese language learning.
"This has really promoted mutual understanding of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania since 2013," said Malangwa.
The Spring Festival, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, falls on Feb. 10.
Zhang Xiaozhen, the Chinese director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Dar es Salaam, said the Spring Festival is the oldest and most important traditional festival in Chinese culture, adding that it is a festive day for all families to reunite, bid farewell to the old and welcome the new.
"The Spring Festival belongs to China and also the world," said Zhang, adding that this year is the Year of the Dragon.
Chen Jian, executive manager of the CCCC Tanzania Office, said the Chinese Lunar New Year has always been a time of joy and happiness, and a time of family reunions, feasts, new clothes, and a sleepless night with carnivals. â–

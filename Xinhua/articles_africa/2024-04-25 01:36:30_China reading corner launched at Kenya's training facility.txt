NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya School of Government, a state-owned training facility for civil servants, inaugurated a China corner library on Wednesday, stocked with books covering humanities and sciences from China.
This initiative aims to help local officials gain a deeper understanding of China's history, economic reforms, rejuvenation efforts and political philosophy.
Charles Nyachae, chairman of the Council of the Kenya School of Government, said that China's journey of socio-economic renewal serves as an inspiration to local citizens, highlighting the importance of understanding China's technological advancements, stability and governance model.
"China's transformation over the decades is a testament to the power of vision, strategic planning and unwavering dedication to development," Nyachae said. He noted that several groups within the Kenyan civil service have utilized scholarships funded by China to pursue advanced studies.

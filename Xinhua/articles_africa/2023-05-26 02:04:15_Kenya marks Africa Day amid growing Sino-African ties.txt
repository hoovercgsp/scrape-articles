NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya on Thursday joined the rest of Africa in marking Africa Day.
The celebrations, which commemorated the 60th anniversary of the creation of the Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the African Union, took place in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi and drew diplomats from African countries who are based in Kenya.
Alfred Ombudo K'Ombudo, principal secretary of the State Department of Trade, said that the Africa Day festivities are an important occasion for the celebration of African culture as well as the continent's growing resilience.
K'Ombudo said that Kenya is keen to boost both intra-Africa trades as well as commercial and investment ties with other countries such as China. He noted that China remains an important partner to Kenya as the East African nation is a beneficiary of Chinese investments especially in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.
South Sudanese Ambassador to Kenya Chol Ajonga said that Africa Day celebrations are a reminder of Africa's people's struggle to achieve both political and economic independence.
Ajonga noted that one of the continent's key allies is China which has been a source of foreign investments in key sectors of the African continent. He stressed that China is providing Africa with things that the continent needs in order to achieve development such as critical infrastructure projects including roads and railways.
"We look forward to more cooperation with China in the future," he observed. â–

KAMPALA, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) on Thursday awarded 218 students from the oil-rich districts of Hoima and Kikuube in western Uganda.
According to a statement issued by CNOOC Uganda Limited, the awards, held in collaboration with local education offices, aim to promote academic excellence and support education in the Bunyoro sub-region.
The students, who excelled in the Primary Leaving Examinations, Uganda Certificate of Education and Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education in 2023, received cash prizes and certificates. These awards are intended to encourage their continued academic success and inspire future scholars, the statement said.
The company reaffirmed its commitment to the development of local communities through education, infrastructure and sustainable growth.

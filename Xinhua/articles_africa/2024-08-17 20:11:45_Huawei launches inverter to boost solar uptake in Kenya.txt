NAIROBI, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese technology firm Huawei launched its 150K series Commercial and Industry inverter on Friday, aiming to enhance solar energy adoption in Kenya.
Du Peng, chief executive officer of Huawei Digital Power Eastern Africa Region, said in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, that the inverter enables solar panels to generate more power by reducing system losses for commercial and industrial users.
"The new device enhances safety by providing real-time software and hardware fault detection," Du said during the Huawei FusionSolar Eastern Africa Partner Summit 2024.
The day-long event brought together renewable energy industry leaders and practitioners, and advocates to review ways to expand green and sustainable development in Kenya.
Data from the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority indicates that Kenya's installed electricity capacity stands at 3,112 MW, with solar contributing 210 MW.
Nick Lusson, vice president of Huawei Digital Power Eastern Africa Region, said that the new inverters are more cost-effective due to fewer required accessories, resulting in lower installation costs.
He noted that the inverter's technology allows solar panels to harness energy for extended periods during daylight hours. â–

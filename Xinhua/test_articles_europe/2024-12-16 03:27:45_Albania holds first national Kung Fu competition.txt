TIRANA, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The first National Kung Fu Competition of Albania was held here on Sunday, bringing together young martial artists from six Albanian cities.
The event was organized by the Shaolin Kung Fu Albania Academy, with support from the Chinese Embassy and German Embassy.
Throughout the year, the academy has been running programs aimed at inspiring Albanian youth aged 14-18 in cities such as Tirana, Berat, Pogradec, Korce, Tropoje, and Shkoder. Operating under the motto, "You are worth it! You can do it!", these initiatives have fostered physical fitness, self-confidence, and discipline among participants.
Deputy major of Tirana Keti Luarasi welcomed this event, saying that there is nothing more beautiful than young people getting active in all possible sports, while teaching themselves practice, rules and discipline.
"We should organize as many sport activities as possible, so that children can get involved in sports, to train their minds and bodies, and to have a healthier youth." added Luarasi.
Counselor of Chinese Embassy Wang Dexin highlighted the cultural and physical benefits of martial arts, noting that it strengthens the body, promotes health, and offers a window into traditional Chinese culture. "This competition is a great opportunity for young people from different Albanian cities to come together, compete, and build friendships," said Wang.
Over three hours of intense competition, 30 participants aged 14 to 19 displayed their skills across various Kung Fu forms.
The Shaolin Kung Fu Albania Academy, founded by martial arts master Albert Kola in 2014, is the first Chinese martial arts school in Albania. â–

TIRANA, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian edition of The Analects of Confucius, published by the Papyrus Books Publishing House, was officially launched at the Confucius Institute at the University of Tirana on Wednesday.
Benet Koleka, executive director of Papyrus Books and chief translator of the book, told Xinhua that the translation process took about three years, with Chinese scholars playing a vital role in refining the text to ensure greater accuracy in conveying the meanings of Confucius' teachings.
"Although the book discusses philosophy, many of its ideas are highly applicable to modern life," said Koleka. "For example, the saying, 'Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire,' offers valuable guidance for daily living."
The Analects of Confucius, or Lunyu in Chinese, is a renowned collection of teachings and ideas from the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius (551 B.C.-479 B.C.).
Iljaz Spahiu, president of the Albania-China Cultural Association and a well-known translator, highlighted the significance of the new translation. "We already have Albanian editions of works by Lao Zi and Sun Zi, two other prominent Chinese philosophers," Spahiu told Xinhua. "This book will further enrich the understanding of Chinese culture and philosophy among Albanian readers."
Cultural similarities between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, such as respect for elders and strong family values, will help Confucius' ideas resonate well with Albanian readers, Spahiu noted.
Some university professors in Albania are considering incorporating the book into their philosophy courses as a textbook or reference material, Spahiu added. â–

ROME, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Respecting diversity and building bridges between cultures is a crucial legacy of Marco Polo's adventure, an Italian curator of a Marco Polo-themed exhibition said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
Chiara Squarcina, director of the Foundation of Civil Museums of Venice, emphasized that Marco Polo's journey to the East reflected a profound spirit of openness and a deep appreciation for the diversity of civilizations.
From April to September this year, the renowned Doge's Palace in Venice - Marco Polo's hometown - hosted an exhibition called "The Worlds of Marco Polo: The Journey of a 13th-Century Venetian Merchant."
The exhibition featured 48 Chinese artifacts, including ceramics, musical instruments, and jade pieces, loaned by the Shanghai Museum. The treasures recreated the cultural landscapes along the Silk Road that Marco Polo encountered during his travels.
As the leading curator of the exhibition, Squarcina highlighted the successful collaboration with China's Shanghai Museum, describing her Chinese counterparts as "highly professional and supportive."
"Our goal was to showcase Marco Polo's encounters with diverse cultures and to share that experience with the world," Squarcina said. "Today, more than ever, we need to embrace his spirit of listening to others and accepting different cultures without prejudice."
"To gain true knowledge, one must have an open and peaceful mind, just as Marco Polo demonstrated during his journeys," she added, stressing that mutual respect is the cornerstone of mutual understanding among civilizations.
Following its Venice debut, the exhibition moved to the Shanghai Museum in November, where it will run until next March. Squarcina expressed her excitement over the fruitful partnership between Chinese and Italian museums, and said she is looking forward to future collaborations.
"Museums and exhibitions not only preserve history but also teach us that beauty emerges from peace, not conflict," she noted.
"We hope visitors see Marco Polo as a friend, and a travel companion who shares cultures," she said. â–

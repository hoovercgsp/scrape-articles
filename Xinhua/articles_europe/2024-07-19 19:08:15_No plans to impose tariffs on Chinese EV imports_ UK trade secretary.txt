LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said at the G7 Trade Ministers' Meeting in Italy on Wednesday that the United Kingdom (UK) has no plans to follow the European Union's measure of imposing tariffs on the imports of Chinese electric vehicles.
According to the Financial Times, the UK automotive industry has not formally requested the UK Trade Remedies Authority to conduct an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicle imports, which is a necessary step before initiating such an investigation.
However, Reynolds also mentioned that the possibility of imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles is not ruled out, as long as the decision benefits the country's automotive export sector.
Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders shows that in 2023, the UK exported about 700,000 cars, with only 7 percent of these exported to China, while 60 percent were exported to the 27 EU countries. Meanwhile, the domestic electric vehicle market in the UK is dominated by Chinese-made brands, including MG, owned by China's SAIC Motor.
In an editorial on Thursday, the Financial Times said that Western leaders must choose between achieving climate goals and embracing trade protectionism. However, for the benefit of all, Western governments should abandon trade protectionism at some point.
"If Europe is serious about its EV goals, the problem is not too many Chinese imports but rather too few, given how slow its own industry has been in shifting away from internal combustion technology," said the editorial. â–

OSLO, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Norway's salmon exports to China reached 230 million Norwegian kroner (22.46 million U.S. dollars) in July, marking an impressive 90 percent increase compared to the same month last year, the Norwegian Seafood Council (NSC) said in a press release on Thursday.
In terms of volume, Norway shipped 3,253 metric tons of salmon to China last month, representing a 59 percent increase from the previous year.
This surge in demand for Norwegian salmon has played a significant role in driving the country's seafood export growth. "This has been an unprecedented July for salmon exports to China," Andreas Thorud, NSC's representative in China, said in a statement.
Thorud pointed out that the demand for Norwegian salmon in China was primarily driven by the restaurant segment, while grocery stores and e-commerce platforms were also witnessing a surge in sales. He emphasized the exciting trend of Norwegian salmon making its way into grocery stores beyond major cities, expanding its reach to medium and small cities in China.
According to the data, the Nordic country exported 12.4 billion Norwegian kroner worth of seafood in July, showing a substantial rise of 928 million Norwegian kroner or 8 percent from the previous year.
One of the key factors contributing to this positive trend has been the weakness of the Norwegian krone, which has bolstered the competitiveness of Norwegian seafood in the global market, Christian Chramer, managing director of the NSC, said in the release.

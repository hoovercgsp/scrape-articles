Addressing the opening ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Slovakia Cai Ge said that China-Slovakia relations have made great progress over the past 75 years, and films play a unique role in enhancing people-to-people ties between the two countries.
He extended invitations to the Slovak people to visit China and experience in person the lives of the Chinese people and the development of China.
Mario Maruska, State Secretary of the Slovak Ministry of Culture, said in his speech that this long-term mutual cooperation contributed to the development of material, intellectual and also spiritual wealth of the two countries, while "the persisting driving force of the rapprochement of our nations" is undoubtedly the area of cultural cooperation.

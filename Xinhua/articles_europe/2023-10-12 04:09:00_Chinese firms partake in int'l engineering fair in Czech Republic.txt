PRAGUE, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 Chinese companies are participating in the ongoing Brno International Engineering Fair in the Czech Republic's second-largest city Brno.
The Chinese firms are showcasing products, including laser cutting machines, machine tools, bearings, motors, and photovoltaic equipment during the four-day fair inaugurated on Tuesday.
Some of these companies are first-time exhibitors, while others have been returning for several years, all sharing a common goal -- to explore business opportunities.
Jinan Xintian Technology Co. Ltd, based in China's Shandong Province, has already sold two laser products to Czech clients. "We brought to the fair three laser products, and they are very popular," Wu Yunhui, a sales manager from the company told Xinhua.
Bodor Laser, a Chinese producer of laser cutting machines, has expanded its exhibition area this year and witnessed significant growth in the Czech market over the past year.
"We established contacts with 57 potential customers last year, this year we expect to double that figure," Zhao Bin, marketing director from Bodor, told Xinhua.
Li Dongxu, a representative from the Machinery Sub-Council of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade -- the organizer of the Chinese companies for this year's event, highlighted the Brno fair as a significant industrial expo in Central and Eastern Europe.
The Brno International Engineering Fair, traditionally focused on machine tools and forming machines, has expanded to include automation, industrial robots, 3D printing, and digitization. This year's event features over 1,300 participating companies. â–

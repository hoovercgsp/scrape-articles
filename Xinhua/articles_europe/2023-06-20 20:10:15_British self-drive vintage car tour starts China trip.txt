HOHHOT, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A self-drive tour fleet comprising ten vintage cars started from London, Britain, and entered China on Monday from the Erenhot Port in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the largest land port between China and Mongolia.
The tour group with 12 participants will head to Beijing via Ulanqab of Inner Mongolia and Zhangjiakou of Hebei Province.
"I am happy to have my number plate for my car, and I am very excited to be staying in Erenhot," George Ratcliffe, one of the participants, said at the Erenhot Port.
The local customs authorities said it has streamlined customs clearance procedures and granted a fast-track passage to the fleet.
The local police also helped ensure the smooth issuance of licenses, such as the provisional number plates for the cars.
The vintage cars in the fleet span a time frame from the 1920s to the 1970s. â–

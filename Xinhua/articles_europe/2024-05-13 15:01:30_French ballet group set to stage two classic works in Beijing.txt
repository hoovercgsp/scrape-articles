BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Le Ballet de l'Opéra National de Bordeaux, or the Ballet of the Bordeaux National Opera, will be staging two classic ballet works at the National Center for the Performing Arts (NCPA) in Beijing.
The two works, "La Sylphide" and "Don Quixote (Act III)," will be presented by the group on May 18 and 19 at the NCPA.
The NCPA is the last stop of the group's China tour as this year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France and the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism.
As part of this tour, the group earlier performed the two ballets at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center and engaged in a series of cultural exchange events. ■

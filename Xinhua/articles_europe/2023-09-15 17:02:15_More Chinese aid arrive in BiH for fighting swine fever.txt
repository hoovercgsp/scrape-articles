SARAJEVO, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The second batch of materials donated by China for fighting the African swine fever was handed over to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Thursday.
A handover ceremony was held in the city of Gradiska in the northwestern region of the Republika Srpska (RS), one of the BiH's two entities.
The aid consists of funds and equipment to fight the spread of the swine fever.
In the presence of RS President Milorad Dodik, a document on the handover of the aid was signed at the ceremony at the customs terminal in Gradiska by Chinese Ambassador to BiH Ji Ping and Director of the BiH Veterinary Office Sasa Boskovic.
Ji said that livestock farming is one of the pillars of agriculture in BiH, but the outbreak of the African swine fever has seriously affected the livelihood of about 600 farmers.
He hoped that the donation will help farmers reduce losses and contribute to a rapid post-epidemic recovery of BiH's economy.
At the end of July, the Chinese Embassy in BiH donated the first batch of anti-swine-fever aid to the RS, following the World Organization for Animal Health confirmed the outbreak of the animal disease there in June.
The RS government declared a state of emergency in the northeast region on July 10. â–

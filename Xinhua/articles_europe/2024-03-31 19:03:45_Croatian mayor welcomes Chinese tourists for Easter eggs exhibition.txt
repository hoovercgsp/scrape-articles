KOPRIVNICA, Croatia, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Misel Jaksic, mayor of Koprivnica in northern Croatia, voiced his welcome to Chinese tourists as the annual traditional outdoor Easter eggs exhibition is underway in the city.
Although Croatia is perhaps best known for its Mediterranean tourism, "we are convinced that the continental part of Croatia also offers incredible experiences," Jaksic said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
According to the mayor, the Easter eggs combine tradition and a public space available to all visitors, curious people and lovers of naive painting, and the painters use special painting techniques that were developed precisely in small rural areas in the houses of workers, farmers, and artists of the region.
Moreover, the motifs on the Easter eggs depict the landscape and rural life of the region, as it once was and as it can still be found in its hidden corners, hills and agricultural plains, Jaksic said.
On March 14, the Tourist Board of Koprivnica-Krizevci County unveiled its annual exhibition of large decorated Easter eggs on the city's center square, and the Easter eggs, 2.05-meter high and 1.5-meter wide each, are believed to be the largest in Croatia.
The Easter eggs from Koprivnica, while having enjoyed the status of Intangible Croatian Cultural Heritage, have been gifted to other cities including Munich, Rome, New York, Prague, and Vienna. â–

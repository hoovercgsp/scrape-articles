BARCELONA, Spain, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is working to promote economic growth in a sustainable fashion, a Spanish expert has said.
The Chinese government is not solely focusing on business sectors exhibiting extraordinary growth, but rather on all sectors, said Pedro Nueno, a professor at IESE Business School.
The interview with Nueno was conducted shortly after the conclusion of the annual sessions of China's top legislature and top political advisory body, or the "two sessions."
During this year's two sessions, the development of the private sector and the well-being of private enterprises are among the issues enjoying considerable attention.
"State-owned enterprises, private enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises are all important forces in China's modernization," read the government work report approved at the national legislature.
Such official stance is crucial, because it helps to ensure equitable distribution of profits across the nation in the long term, which ultimately benefits all companies, said Nueno, also founder and honorary president of the China Europe International Business School.
By engaging actively in the Chinese market, foreign-funded companies, including European ones, stand to enhance their stability and growth prospects, he said, adding that business expansion of Chinese companies overseas also benefits both China and European countries.
At the two sessions this year, pursuing common prosperity for all was again highlighted to be an essential feature of Chinese modernization.
"One clear objective of the Chinese government has been to reduce poverty in China and this is something that has been achieved," said Nueno.
As for misunderstanding of China in the West, Nueno said that by observing the two sessions, negative views on China could be dispelled.
"It showed that the country is being well run," he said. "It is opportune to show how things are being negotiated and done well." â–

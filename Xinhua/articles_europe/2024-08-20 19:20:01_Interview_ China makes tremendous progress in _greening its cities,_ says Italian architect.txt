ROME, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian architect Stefano Boeri has praised China's recent advancements in green development, highlighting the country's significant strides towards sustainability.
"China has made tremendous progress in greening its cities," Boeri said in a recent interview with Xinhua. The architect, renowned for designing Milan's Vertical Forest -- a pair of residential skyscrapers enveloped in lush greenery -- commended China's efforts in urban sustainability.
Completed in 2014, the Vertical Forest is globally acclaimed for its fusion of modern architecture with extensive plant life, earning several international awards. Boeri, the visionary behind the project, emphasized the growing need for green spaces in urban environments dominated by concrete and steel. He noted that China is making significant strides in addressing this need.
"The transformation is evident the moment you land in cities like Beijing, Shenzhen, or Shanghai," Boeri remarked. He commended China's "tremendous effort" in reducing air pollution, decreasing airborne dust, and advancing private mobility by promoting electric vehicles.
The Italian architect also highlighted the significant increase in urban green spaces as another major achievement in China's sustainable development.
Boeri, who first visited China in 1979, expressed his long-standing admiration for the country, emphasizing its unique cultural and historical depth. He described China as "one of the epicenters of contemporary life on the planet."
Through his studios in China, Boeri has introduced his Vertical Forest concept to several cities including Shanghai, Nanjing, Huanggang and Shenzhen, further contributing to the country's evolving urban landscape.
"China is currently making a significant and important effort to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, aligning with one of the United Nations' key targets," he added. â–

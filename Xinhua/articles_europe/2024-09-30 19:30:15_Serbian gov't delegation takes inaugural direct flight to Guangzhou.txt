BELGRADE, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- A Serbian government delegation boarded Air Serbia's inaugural direct flight to Guangzhou, China on Sunday evening, following a ceremony at the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport.
The event was attended by Serbia's Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure Goran Vesic, Minister of Tourism and Youth Husein Memic, Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Li Ming, and Air Serbia CEO Jiri Marek.
Leading the delegation, Vesic highlighted that the new direct flights operated by Air Serbia and China Southern Airlines symbolize "a significant contribution to the steel-clad friendship between the two peoples."
He also congratulated China on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, noting the importance of the growing economic and overall ties between the two countries.
"Economic relations between Serbia and China are becoming increasingly significant. Since July 1, the free trade agreement between our two countries has been in effect, and we expect even more businesspeople to come here," Vesic said.
Li said the flight is a significant achievement in bilateral cooperation, calling it "an air bridge" between the two nations.
He noted that the new route would bring substantial benefits, citing an 84 percent increase in Chinese tourists visiting Belgrade in the first quarter of this year.
Marek said the day was exceptional for the airline, both countries and the entire region. "By adding Guangzhou to our network, we are expanding our presence in China."
"Guangzhou is one of the largest commercial and industrial centers in China, and we believe these direct flights will be of great interest to the business community across Europe," Marek said.
The new direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou's Baiyun International Airport will operate four times a week -- two by Air Serbia and two by China Southern Airlines, according to Vesic. â–

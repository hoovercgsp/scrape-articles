LJUBLJANA, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- As the parade of the Chinese cheongsam team and lion dance team entered the Ljubljana City Hall Square, the 30th Diplomatic SILA Bazaar officially kicked off here on Saturday.
China is the guest country of the charity event which involved 48 countries this year. The Chinese Embassy in Slovenia, the Confucius Institute in Ljubljana, and several other Chinese societies set up five booths there.
Chinese handicrafts, such as tea sets, silk scarves, folding fans, chopsticks, and panda dolls, as well as typical traditional Chinese food, were provided at the event. Tea art performances and calligraphy workshops were also held.
Wang Shunqing, Chinese ambassador to Slovenia, said that this event not only reflects the enthusiasm of various countries for charity but also serves as a cultural feast that will deepen understanding and enhance friendship between countries.
The annual bazaar has been held since 1993 and is now the largest charity bazaar in Slovenia.
This year, the collected funds are expected to be allocated to Slovenian children in need. Part of the funds will be allocated to families affected by this year's floods. â–

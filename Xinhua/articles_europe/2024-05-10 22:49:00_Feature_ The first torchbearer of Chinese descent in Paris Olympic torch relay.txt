MARSEILLE, France, May 10 (Xinhua) -- At 42 years old, Liu Jia, a Chinese-born Austrian table tennis player, took part in the Paris Olympic torch relay in Marseille on Thursday. As the first torchbearer of Chinese descent in this relay, Liu's participation marked a significant moment in the event.
Originally from Beijing and a childhood friend of Olympic champion Zhang Yining, Liu moved to Austria in 1997 and later became an Austrian citizen, representing the country in international competitions. She won three gold medals at the 1998 European Youth Championships in women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles and secured a victory at the European Championships in 2005.
Liu has represented Austria in six consecutive Olympic Games since 2000, with a notable moment during the 2016 Rio Olympics where she served as the flag bearer for the Austrian delegation during the opening ceremony.
"Seeing the torch arrive here yesterday was truly stunning. Not every athlete can be an Olympic champion, but I've been a flag bearer, and now a torchbearer, being an athlete has truly been worth it in my life," Liu expressed excitedly.
Participating as a "collective torchbearer," a new concept introduced by the Paris Olympics organizers, Liu was part of a group relay where multiple torchbearers acted as one unit. This initiative aims to involve more people in the relay, aligning with the Olympic slogan "Games Wide Open" and highlighting the theme of unity.
The relay leg on "Europe Day" included more than 20 athletes from various European countries and regions, spanning both Olympic and Paralympic sports and including both summer and winter events. Liu likened the event to a "family gathering."
"I think the Olympics is not just about competitive sports; it also conveys a message that the world is one family. Like this group relay, although we come from different corners of the world and engage in different sports, celebrating and passing the torch together, I feel that everyone can share this sentiment and hope for a better world," Liu told Xinhua.
In addition to her sports career, Liu coaches young table tennis players in Austria and works in the baking supplies industry.
"I'm going to Shanghai next week for an exhibition. Right now, I want to keep doing everything and give up nothing. But no matter what I do, my background as an athlete is always there, it's my underlying color," said Liu.
When greeted in Chinese at the relay's starting point, Liu, recognizing the language and seeing a familiar face, joyfully responded, "I am Chinese." â–

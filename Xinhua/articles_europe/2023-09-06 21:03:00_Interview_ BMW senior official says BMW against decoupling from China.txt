MUNICH, Germany, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW is against decoupling from China, Oliver Zipse, chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
"Decoupling from China is impossible," Zipse said. "China is so important in terms of raw materials, manufacturing competence, size, and economies of scale."
In the first half of this year, the BMW Group delivered more than 390,000 BMW and MINI brand vehicles to the Chinese market, an increase of 3.7 percent year-on-year, and among these vehicles, sales of BMW pure electric models increased by 283 percent year-on-year, according to the BMW Group.
"China is BMW's largest market, and we are very connected and involved in the Chinese market," Zipse noted.
According to the BMW senior official, independence is impossible for the automotive industry, and the discussion should instead focus on how to cooperate.
There are many types of cooperation, and "cooperation is always a super positive thing," he said, adding that he believes benefits can only be achieved together and in both ways, for BMW and also for its Chinese partners.
Zipse mentioned the Spotlight joint venture, an example of successful cooperation between the BMW Group and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors. Cars made by Spotlight in Zhangjiagang, east China's Jiangsu Province are going to be exported.
Referring to incoming Chinese automakers, Zipse said that competition and free trade should be embraced. â–

MADRID, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Spain's capital Madrid will welcome the Chinese Year of the Dragon with a series of activities, including parades, concerts, displays of Chinese artisan traditions, a culinary festival and a race across the city.
The celebration plan, which will last until the end of February, was officially presented on Friday at a ceremony attended by Chinese Ambassador to Spain Yao Jing and Madrid's Mayor Jose Luis Almeida.
"I am very happy to partake in this festival together with the Chinese community and with the people of Madrid. Wherever I go in Spain, I feel the sympathy of the Spanish people towards China and their interest and passion for Chinese culture," Yao said.
Although the Chinese New Year festival, also known as the Spring Festival, has its roots in China but "belongs to the world," he added.
Yao welcomed the United Nations (UN) General Assembly's acceptance of the Spring Festival as a UN holiday. The decision made the festival "more internationally celebrated," he told Xinhua.
Almeida said the Spring Festival will "help deepen cultural understanding that benefits both the city of Madrid and the Chinese community."
"It will allow us to quench our thirst for Chinese culture and get acquainted with the traditions, customs and ancient history of China," he said. â–

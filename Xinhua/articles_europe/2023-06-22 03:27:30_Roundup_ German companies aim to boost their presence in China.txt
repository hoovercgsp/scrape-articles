STUTTGART, June 21 (Xinhua) -- German companies explored ways of boosting their presence in China at an event in Stuttgart on Tuesday.
Over 150 representatives from German businesses such as Bosch, Porsche, and Trumpf attended the "Taicang Day" event, which is named after the Taicang city, east China's Jiangsu Province. The city is now home to 487 German companies.
Participants agreed that the Chinese market provides crucial opportunities for German companies.
Waelzholz, a global manufacturer of steel materials headquartered in Hagen, Germany, began making tentative inroads into the Chinese market some 20 years ago. Encouraged by the "huge demand" for its products in China, the company then decided to begin producing locally.
Matthias Gierse, managing director of Waelzholz's Sales and Purchasing department, expects that the momentum of the company's business growth in China will be sustained.
Zhu Weige, the economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese Consulate General in Frankfurt, noted that regional cooperation has always been an important part of Sino-German relations. He looked forward to welcoming more German companies to invest in Taicang.
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Board of the German Federal Association for Economic Development and Foreign Trade (BWA) Michael Schumann said that Taicang has epitomized successful cooperation between German and Chinese companies.
According to a survey recently conducted by China Netzwerk Baden-Wuerttemberg on over 100 German companies, around 80 percent of respondents believed that China would remain an extremely important procurement and sales market for German companies in the long run. About half of the companies surveyed said they would deepen their cooperation with Chinese business partners. â–

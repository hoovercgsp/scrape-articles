LONDON, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The British Library expanded its Chinese collection on Thursday by adding ten online novels by Chinese authors, including Lord of the Mysteries, Soul Land, and The Joy of Life.
This follows the library's 2022 inclusion of its first batch of Chinese online literature.
These novels, originally published on platforms operated by Yuewen, a Chinese online literature company, were donated to document the cultural significance and rapid development of internet literature in China.
Jas Rai, Chief Operating Officer of the British Library, said that they are excited to collaborate with Chinese publishers to engage audiences in the United Kingdom (UK), highlighting the library's dedication to enhancing accessibility and diversifying its offerings.
Rai added that Chinese online literature showcases the growing diversity in storytelling, offering innovative ways for global audiences to connect with stories.
By the end of 2023, the number of Chinese online literature readers reached a record 537 million, with the overseas market for this genre surpassing 4 billion yuan, spanning over 200 countries and regions.
Qianshanchake, a Chinese web novelist whose work Stacie was included in the library's collection, expressed excitement and surprise at the recognition. She said she believes the adventurous themes and Oriental elements will resonate with British and European readers. "The core themes of novels are universal, transcending cultural boundaries," she added.
The announcement also marked the launch of a three-year collaboration, Literature in the Digital Age, between the British Library and Yuewen. A roundtable forum on the same theme was held in London, bringing together publishing professionals from both nations to share insights.
"This is a burgeoning cultural collaboration between the UK and China," said Rupert Daniels, Director of Creative, Consumer, Sports, and Education at the UK Department for Business and Trade. He expressed hope that the partnership would introduce global readers to captivating stories through innovative technologies.
The British Library houses over 170 million items, including books, manuscripts, newspapers, and sound recordings. â–

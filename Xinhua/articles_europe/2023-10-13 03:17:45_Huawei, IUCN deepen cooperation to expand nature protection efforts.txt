GENEVA, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tech giant Huawei and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Thursday signed a strategic cooperation agreement here to launch Phase 2 of their "Tech4Nature" partnership.
The partnership, initially launched in 2020, supports the 30x30 target defined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which calls for conserving 30 percent of the Earth's land and sea areas by establishing protected areas and effective area-based conservation measures.
Phase 2 will expand the use of digital technologies to enhance the management of protected and conserved areas. IUCN and Huawei will jointly develop technology-based solutions for pilot projects in several countries, including Brazil, Kenya, Türkiye, Mexico, and China.
"Technology allows us to bridge the gap between science and action," said Grethel Aguilar, acting IUCN director general, during the signing ceremony.
"We believe that the Tech4Nature initiative will build on the success of the first phase and expand its global impact," said Senior Vice President of Huawei Peng Song. "We also believe that more partners will join the Tech4Nature initiative."
The IUCN, headquartered in Gland, Switzerland, is an international non-profit nature conservation organization. ■

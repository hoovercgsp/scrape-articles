BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the European Union (EU) will honor its commitment to upholding free trade and opposing protectionism, and work with China to maintain the overall interest of China-EU economic and trade cooperation, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular press briefing when responding to remarks of Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, that "decoupling" from China is very difficult. Borrell expressed the hope in a recent interview for continuing mutually beneficial trade with China that is both fair and balanced. Borrell also said that the EU will not follow the United States in imposing tariffs on China, and that a trade war must be avoided.
Mao said the China-EU economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, adding that protectionism only leads to a dead end while openness and cooperation are the correct ways.
She noted that China and the EU are each other's second largest trading partners, with an average trade value of nearly 1.5 million U.S. dollars per minute. In addition, the total value of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars, and companies from both sides continue to increase investment in each other's markets.
The China-Europe freight train service has recorded over 90,000 trips, creating a significant trade channel between Asia and Europe. The supply, industrial and value chains of both sides are already integrated and intertwined, she said.
Mao added China will continue to promote high-level opening up and provide an open, inclusive and transparent business environment for enterprises from all countries. â–

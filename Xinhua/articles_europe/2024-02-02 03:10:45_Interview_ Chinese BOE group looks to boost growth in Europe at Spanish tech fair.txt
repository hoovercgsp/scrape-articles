BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- China's BOE Technology Group, a leading Chinese electronic components producer, is looking to boost growth in Europe by taking part in the Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) technology fair held this week in Spain.
BOE is among more than 1,300 exhibitors at the 20th edition of the fair in Barcelona, which runs from Jan. 30 to Feb. 2. Some 300 of these exhibitors are from China.
"This event gives us a lot of opportunities to get more potential customers. I believe that in three to five years our revenue can double in Europe," Xu Jianhong, General Manager of BOE Europe, told Xinhua.
BOE says it makes one out of every four display products in the world, along with other solutions in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices, and micro-LED, sensor and medical technology.
"Our company can offer the kind of product that fulfills the demands of the European customer: high quality, safe (...), the price is acceptable, and our partners are high brands," Xu added.
BOE has subsidiaries in 20 countries and regions, including Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland, as well as in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates.
"The most important message from Headquarters is to grow in the European market, and I think we can achieve more than 10 percent of our sales revenue from this market," said Xu Jianhong.
With some 80,000 registrations, ISE 2024 is set to surpass last year's 58,000 attendees. Covering 82,000 square meters of exhibition space, almost a third more than in 2023, it is also the largest edition of the trade fair ever. â–

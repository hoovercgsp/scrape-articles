ISTANBUL, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU's) decision to levy tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) is a bad decision harmful for the European economy, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said here Friday.
Attending the Istanbul Energy Forum here at the Istanbul Congress Centre, a one-day event organized by Anadolu Agency under the auspices of the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Szijjarto told Xinhua that Hungary regrets the EU's decision, which is "anti-democratic" as only 10 out of the 27 EU member states backed it.
"We are in favor of enhancing cooperation with China," especially economic cooperation, he said, noting that many Chinese investors are now active in Hungary.
"The EU should make better and more active cooperation with China when it comes to trade and economy," he added.
On Oct. 29, the EU announced a controversial decision to impose tariffs of up to 45.3 percent on Chinese EVs for at least five years.
On Nov. 8, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said China and the EU had made progress in negotiations on a proposed price commitment plan concerning Chinese EVs. â–

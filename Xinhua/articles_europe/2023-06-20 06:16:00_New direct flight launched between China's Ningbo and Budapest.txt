BUDAPEST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing B787-9 Dreamliner of Shanghai Airlines, a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines, was warmly received at Liszt Ferenc International Airport in Budapest, Hungary's capital city, on Monday night.
China Eastern Airlines commenced a direct flight service between east China's Ningbo city and Budapest.
"Thanks to Shanghai Airlines, there will be two flights per week between Ningbo and Budapest from July," Tamas Menczer, state secretary for bilateral relations of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said at a press conference at the airport.
So far, a total of four major Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Ningbo, and Chongqing, have had direct accessibility from Budapest.
Menczer highlighted the significance of Ningbo, a city with a population of nearly 10 million located in Zhejiang Province, which is one of the wealthiest regions in China.
The Hungarian state secretary underscored the importance of the relations between Hungary and China, which were elevated to the level of a "comprehensive strategic partnership" over the past 11 years.
Menczer said that Hungary has become the prime destination for Chinese investors in Central and Eastern Europe.
Qiu Jie, general manager of the Budapest office of China Eastern Airlines, recalled that this flight marks the first-ever non-stop intercontinental route between Ningbo and Budapest.
"I'm confident that the new route between Ningbo and Budapest will play an active role in the cooperation and development in many fields between our two nations," he said.
Qiu said that China Eastern Airlines has plans to increase two more direct flights from Shanghai "very soon." â–

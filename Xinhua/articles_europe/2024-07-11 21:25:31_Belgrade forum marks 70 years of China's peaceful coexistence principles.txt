BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a round table in Belgrade on Thursday praised China's Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence as a significant contribution to global diplomacy and international cooperation.
The event, organized by the Institute of International Politics and Economics (IIPE) and marking the 70th anniversary of these principles, brought together Serbian and Chinese scholars and officials, including China's ambassador to Serbia, Li Ming, and IIPE director Branislav Djordjevic.
Djordjevic noted that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence represent a profound contribution of Chinese political thought to global diplomatic history and the peaceful development of state cooperation in international relations.
He appreciated China for its steadfast support of Serbia's territorial integrity, particularly in rejecting the self-declared independence of Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.
Nenad Stekic, a research associate at IIPE, underlined China's principles of equality in international relations, mutual non-aggression, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
He hailed Serbia-China ties, voicing understanding of China's position in international relations and its formulation of foreign security and economic policies.
Li called on the two countries to uphold the international system centered around the United Nations and international law, thereby contributing to global peace and development.
He noted China's seven-decade pursuit of an independent foreign policy of peace guided by the "Five Principles," which has enabled the resolution of border issues with neighboring countries without conflict or territorial occupation.
"China and Serbia, alongside other nations worldwide, should uphold the golden rule of non-interference in internal affairs, oppose imposing their will on others, and refrain from coercing other nations into alignment," Li said. â–

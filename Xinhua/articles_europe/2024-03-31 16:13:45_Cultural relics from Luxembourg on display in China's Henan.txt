ZHENGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 pieces or sets of cultural relics from Luxembourg are being exhibited in Henan Museum in central China.
The exhibition, named "Small but beautiful, treasures of cultural heritage from Luxembourg," kicked off on Wednesday in Zhengzhou, capital city of Henan Province. The exhibition features cultural relics including stoneware, pottery, bronzeware and oil paintings.
The exhibition is being held in accordance with cooperation agreements reached between the Henan Provincial Administration of Cultural Heritage and the National Museum of Archaeology, History and Art of Luxembourg since 2017. In 2018, 145 pieces or sets of artifacts unearthed in Henan were exhibited in Luxembourg.
Ma Xiaolin, curator of Henan Museum, expressed hope that the exhibition will offer Chinese visitors a glimpse into Luxembourg's history, culture and social life, while also boosting the friendship between the two peoples, so as to promote cultural exchanges and mutual learning.
The exhibition will run until August 2024. â–

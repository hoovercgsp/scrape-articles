THE HAGUE, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The resounding clash of gongs and drums echoed through The Hague's ice hockey arena on Friday night as a vibrant lion dance captivated Dutch spectators during the "Happy Spring Festival" celebration.
Organized by the China Cultural Center in The Hague, in collaboration with Hijs Hokij Den Haag, a professional Dutch ice hockey club, and De Uithof Sports Center, the event brought the traditions of Chinese New Year to life during the intermission of a Dutch professional ice hockey match.
The celebration featured an energetic lion dance performance, with the distribution of snake-themed mascots to commemorate the Year of the Snake. The audience on the stand who managed to catch the falling mascots erupted with joy, adding an extra layer of excitement to the evening.
With beaming smiles, many spectators took out their phones to capture the precious moments of interacting with the two dancing lions.
The spectacle left a lasting impression on the about 2,000 spectators, sparking a cultural connection through the thrilling atmosphere of one of the Netherlands' most beloved winter sports.
"It was a unique event, perhaps the first of its kind in Europe. The audience was captivated by the lion dance, which many were unfamiliar with, and they stayed in their seats, applauding enthusiastically," said Jacco Mooijer, Treasurer of Hijs Hokij Den Haag, in an interview with Xinhua.
"This celebration is a fantastic way to introduce Western audiences to Chinese culture, and I'm thrilled to have been part of it," he said.
Jacco, who has visited China several times, shared his fascination with the country's immense scale, rich traditions and culinary delights.
"Every region in the world has unique treasures to share. The Spring Festival embodies a fresh start and positivity for the new season, resonating universally, even in the West. I hope this lion dance becomes an annual tradition here to deepen the connection between our cultures," he said.
Harry Vlaardingerbroek, president of the professional team at Hijs Hokij Den Haag, highlighted the parallels between Dutch and Chinese traditions, particularly the shared emphasis on family and togetherness during major holidays like Christmas and the Spring Festival.
"Both cultures value spending time with family during these celebrations. The timing may differ, but the spirit is the same. It's wonderful to see such cultural exchanges and learn more about each other," Vlaardingerbroek said.
Experiencing a lion dance in the unique setting of an ice rink for the first time, Vlaardingerbroek added: "It's my first time seeing a lion dance in the ice rink, and now I'm eager to learn more about Chinese culture - perhaps even visit China someday."
According to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Spring Festival falls on Jan. 29 this year, marking the beginning of the Year of the Snake. In traditional Chinese culture, the snake symbolizes agility, wisdom, and vitality. â–

FRANKFURT, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two-thirds of the respondents in a survey said that they would consider buying a Chinese car, local German media reported on Friday.
Up to 59 percent of the people surveyed by the German Automobile Club (ADAC) in Germany indicated that buying a Chinese car is an option for them, according to a report of German public broadcast ARD program Tagesschau.
There is an even stronger willingness to buy Chinese cars among young people. Among the people aged 30 to 39, 74 percent of them showed interest in Chinese cars and among those aged 18 to 29, the proportion stands at 72 percent.
Affordability plays a main role in the consideration of those willing to consider buying a Chinese car, according to the survey.
Cars under Chinese brands showed a high level of safety in EURO NCAP crash test, the official new car assessment program in Europe, said a report released from ADAC in April. Base on the tests of 13 different models from China and Europe over the past three years, ADAC concluded in April that "Chinese automakers have improved considerably, and can now keep up with established brands." â–

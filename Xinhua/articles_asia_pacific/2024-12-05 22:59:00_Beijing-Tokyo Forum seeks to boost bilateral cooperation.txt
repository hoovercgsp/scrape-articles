He emphasized that the foundation of bilateral relations lies in public engagement and mutual understanding, adding that the forum's theme is timely and opportune for exploring critical issues as both nations bear significant responsibilities on the global stage.
Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, in a written address, noted the emergence of positive trends in bilateral relations, urging both nations to seize the opportunity and transform it into substantial progress.
During breakout sessions, Japanese participants welcomed China's recent visa-free policy for Japan, considering it a step forward in reinvigorating bilateral relations. Experts from both countries called for strengthened collaboration in areas such as green technology, digital transformation, and regional and global peace.
The joint "Tokyo Consensus" released on Thursday emphasized the importance of building mechanisms of mutual trust, enhancing communication to manage regional crises, and expanding dialogue channels to foster greater public interaction in light of evolving public opinion dynamics.
In a written address at the closing reception Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted that Japan and China bear significant responsibilities in Asia and the world at large, emphasizing that direct dialogue is the starting point for resolving issues and expanding cooperation.
He said the Beijing-Tokyo Forum, now in its 20th year, has played a valuable and important role in fostering mutual understanding between the two nations and expressed hope that the forum will continue to contribute to the development of Japan-China relations.
Established in 2005, the Beijing-Tokyo Forum has been held annually, alternating between Beijing and Tokyo.

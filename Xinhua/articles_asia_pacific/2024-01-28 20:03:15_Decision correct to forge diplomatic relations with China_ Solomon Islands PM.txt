SYDNEY, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Islands made the right decision to establish diplomatic relations with China in 2019, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has said.
In a recent interview with local media Tavuli News, Sogavare said his government's foreign relations are based on the policy of "friends to all, enemy to none."
Noting that in 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, restoring all lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the UN and recognizing the representatives of its government as the only legitimate UN representatives of China, Sogavare stressed that every UN member is obliged to respect the resolution and recognize Taiwan as an integral part of China.
Although the Solomon Islands is a small country, the leaders of some countries, including China, have treated it as an equal, he said.
When the Solomon Islands faced severe challenges such as COVID-19 and riots in recent years, China and other development partners actively provided it with assistance, Sogavare said.
By contrast, at a summit with the Pacific Island countries, the U.S. leader would lecture others for one hour and only give other leaders three minutes to talk, Sogavare said.
"When it comes to Solomon Islands, I will not allow that," he said. "This is a sovereign country. We want to talk as equals no matter how small we are." â–

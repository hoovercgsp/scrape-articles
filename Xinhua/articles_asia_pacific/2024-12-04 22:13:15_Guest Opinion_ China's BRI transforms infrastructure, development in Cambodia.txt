The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has greatly contributed to transforming infrastructure, as well as the economic and trade landscapes in Cambodia over the last decade.
Before the initiation of the BRI in 2013, Cambodia faced significant challenges as one of the poorest countries in the region, with underdeveloped infrastructure hindering its economic progress.
For instance, National Road No. 4, a critical route linking the capital Phnom Penh to the coastal province of Sihanoukville, was severely damaged, increasing transportation costs and slowing economic growth.
The BRI has transformed this landscape. A key highlight is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, which has significantly shortened travel time and enhanced connectivity between the capital and the country's main seaport.
This has not only boosted economic activities but also improved transportation safety and efficiency.
Another major development is the inauguration of the Siem Reap Angkor International Airport in 2023. This modern facility has been instrumental in Cambodia's post-pandemic economic recovery by attracting international flights, increasing tourist arrivals, and elevating the country's reputation as a major global tourist destination.
These projects exemplify the robust cooperation between Cambodia and China under the BRI, delivering tangible benefits in infrastructure, tourism and economic growth.
They have not only improved the quality of life for the Cambodians but also strengthened Cambodia's position in the global economic and tourism landscape.
The convergence of China's BRI with Cambodia's Pentagonal Strategy has created a powerful synergy, generating a "1+1 greater than 2" effect on bilateral and regional cooperation.
Under the leadership of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, the new government prioritizes economic growth, infrastructure development, and improving citizens' well-being.
These goals align seamlessly with the BRI's focus on connectivity and shared prosperity.
For Cambodia, the BRI has offered critical funding and expertise to realize large-scale infrastructure projects.
Tangible results, such as Cambodia's expressway and airport, showcase mutual benefits and serve as persuasive examples of the BRI's value, attracting more participants.
One key reason for the growing popularity of the BRI is China's low-conditionality approach. Unlike some international aid programs, Chinese funding typically comes with fewer strings attached, offering an alternative to traditional aid sources that often impose political or economic conditions.
For many developing countries, this model preserves their sovereignty while meeting critical infrastructure needs.
Additionally, the Build-Operate-Transfer model is particularly appealing.
It allows recipient countries to benefit from infrastructure development without bearing immediate financial burdens, with ownership transferring to the host government after the operational period.
This win-win model, coupled with China's willingness to engage in strategic cooperation, has significantly expanded the BRI's reach, making it a cornerstone of modern global partnerships.
The cooperation between Cambodia and China under the BRI framework significantly contributes to Cambodia's development and bilateral relations. Both countries emphasize the Asian value governance model, focusing on economic growth and the well-being of their peoples.
This shared priority aligns well with Cambodia's vision of transitioning from a least-developed country to an upper-middle-income nation by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050.
Looking to the future, Cambodia is poised to gain development momentum in areas such as digital transformation, sustainable infrastructure and green energy.
To realize its ambitious goals, Cambodia can strengthen collaboration with China on major projects like the next phases of the Siem Reap Angkor and Techo International airports, so as to advance regional connectivity and ensure long-term prosperity.

Aung Thu Soe, 25, talked about his eight months of studying Chinese and the rising job opportunities associated with Chinese language skills due to the presence of many Chinese garment factories in Myanmar.
"Here, there are many Chinese garment factories that were creating job opportunities for Chinese speakers," he said. "I'm drawn to Chinese entertainment, and I also aspire to work in Singapore (a country that uses Chinese language) in the future," he added.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Minister of the Malaysian state of Malacca Ab Rauf Yusoh said on Thursday that the state welcomes investors from China in various sectors and offers them incentives to attract investment.
The minister said so while attending an educational assistance activity held by Edra Power Holdings, a subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corporation, in Malacca on the day.
In his speech at the ceremony, he acknowledged Edra's commendable contributions not only in delivering sustainable energy for the state's economic development, but also in its commitment to delivering positive changes to the lives of those who aspire to learn and achieve success.
He also noted that Malacca is willing to enhance cooperation with China in tourism, art and culture since "the history between Malacca and China has been there for so long for the last 600 years."

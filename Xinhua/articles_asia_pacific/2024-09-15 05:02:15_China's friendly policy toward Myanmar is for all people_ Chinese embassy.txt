YANGON, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- China's friendly policy toward Myanmar is for all Myanmar people, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said on Saturday.
The spokesperson made the remarks in response to groundless accusations by some media and individuals that China interferes in Myanmar's internal affairs.
The spokesperson said that China and Myanmar are traditionally friendly neighbors. China firmly supports Myanmar in safeguarding its independence, sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity, adheres to non-interference in Myanmar's internal affairs and supports the Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led peace process.
China opposes chaos and conflicts in Myanmar, as well as interference in Myanmar's internal affairs by outside forces, and disapproves of any words and deeds that attempt to drive a wedge between China and Myanmar and accuse China groundlessly, the spokesperson stressed.
"We hope relevant parties in Myanmar can cease fire as soon as possible, settle disputes in a peaceful manner, and deescalate and cool down the situation in Myanmar including northern Myanmar," said the spokesperson, adding China will continue to play a constructive role. â–

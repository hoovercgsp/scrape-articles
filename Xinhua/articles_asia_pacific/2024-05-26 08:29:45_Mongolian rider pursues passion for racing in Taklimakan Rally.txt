URUMQI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two years ago, Purevdorj Murun stumbled upon news of the Taklimakan Rally while browsing the internet. This year, he was able to stand on the starting grid, ready to traverse the desert's complex terrain.
"I always wanted to participate in this rally in China, the challenges have intrigued me. However, I couldn't make it last year. But this time, my wish has finally come true," said the Mongolian motorcyclist from the Panda Racing Team.
In Mongolia, motorcycle racing is gaining popularity. The ancient nomadic people, who once lived on horseback, have embraced the thunderous roar of new "iron steeds" in the industrial era.
Murun's father is a renowned racer in Mongolia. Under his influence, Murun developed a love for the sport at a young age. However, the father was initially reluctant to let his son follow in his footsteps, because he was acutely aware of the risks involved.
"My father founded Mongolia's first official motorcycle club and nurtured many riders," Murun said. "For me, age doesn't matter when you find something you love."
He once secretly borrowed a friend's motorcycle and participated in a local race without his parents' knowledge, and clinched second place. That was when his father began to change his mind before finally giving his approval - along with a brand-new motorcycle.
"It's an expensive sport, but whenever I need help, my parents always support me," Murun said. "When I competed, my father gave me a lot of advice, urging me to stay patient, focused and avoid making mistakes."
From his teenage years, Murun began participating in various domestic races. After winning multiple endurance, motocross races and rallies, he decided to expand his horizons overseas, and finished seventh in this year's Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge.
The Taklimakan Rally has been included in the 2024 sporting calendar of the FIA, motorsport's global governing body, allowing manufacturers and clubs to register for entry, boosting the rally's international recognition and appeal.
Murun saw it as an excellent opportunity for his personal growth. He was satisfied with the chance to gain experience and aimed to use it to pursue his ultimate goal - competing in the Dakar Rally.
"When participating in other races, I only knew how to go forward. I rarely had to fix a bike because nothing major went wrong," he explained. "But this time, I learned a lot of techniques, such as the need for dual air filters and a large sprocket to tackle the long desert stages."
With an expanding repertoire of experiences, his understanding of the sport extends beyond the passion fueled by speed.
Before the start of this year's journey in China, he set his sights on breaking into the top six in the motorcycle category. However, he faced an immediate setback in the first stage.
"My engine had a problem on the first day, and because I couldn't finish on official max time, I was penalized by the organizers," the 25-year-old stated. "But it's okay, my current goal is to finish the race successfully."
To Murun, this sport has taught him how to live, pursue his goals and face challenges. "I don't seek perfection. I want to experience different landscapes and cultures in each race and keep moving forward according to my own plans."
In addition, he also aims to share his insights with more people who love this sport.
"I want to open a motorcycle school in my hometown to teach children interested in motorcycles and let them experience the joy of riding," he said. â–

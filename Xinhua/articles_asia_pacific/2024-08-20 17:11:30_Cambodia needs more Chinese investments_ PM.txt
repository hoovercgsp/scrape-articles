PHNOM PENH, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Tuesday that the Southeast Asian country needs more Chinese investments, highlighting potential areas for investment.
Speaking during a meeting in Phnom Penh with a Chinese business delegation comprised of 12 companies, Hun Manet welcomed the interest of Chinese businesspeople in investing in the kingdom, according to a news release from the prime minister's spokesperson unit.
He said that Cambodia has prioritized investments in clean energy, environmental protection, health, agriculture, industry, and finance, among others.
He encouraged the Chinese delegation to discuss with relevant ministries and institutions, especially with the Council for the Development of Cambodia, to gain deeper insights into Cambodia's investment potential.
China is the largest investor and trading partner of Cambodia.
Neak Chandarith, director of the Cambodia 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Research Center, said Chinese-funded enterprises have played an important role in helping boost Cambodia's economy and improving local people's livelihoods.
"Chinese-invested mega-projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) such as the Sihanoukville Special Economy Zone, hydropower plants, Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, the Siem Reap Angkor International Airport, roads, and bridges, among others, have played and will continue to play a crucial role in supporting the kingdom's economy," he told Xinhua.
He said the flagship BRI projects here would help Cambodia achieve its ambitious goals of becoming an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a high-income country in 2050. â–

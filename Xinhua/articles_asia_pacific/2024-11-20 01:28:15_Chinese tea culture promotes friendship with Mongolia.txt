DARKHAN, Mongolia, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- A cultural event on China's tea traditions was held on Tuesday in Darkhan, the capital of Mongolia's northern province of Darkhan-Uul.
Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Shen Minjuan said tea is a treasure of the Chinese nation, embodying thousands of years of cultural heritage.

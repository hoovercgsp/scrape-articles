YANGON, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- A few months ago, a major school building of a high school in Yangon's Hlaingthaya township was in dire need of care.
Thanks to the China-Myanmar friendship school renovation project, the building has been transformed into a clean and safe space for students to study and play.
The two-story building, located at No. 14 Basic Education High School in Hlaingthaya township, currently houses 12 classrooms and serves approximately 2,000 students. The school is one of over 20 China-Myanmar friendship schools across the country.
Daw Cho Cho, the school's headmistress, expressed her gratitude to China for the support. "Under the China-Myanmar friendship school project, the school building was constructed in 2017, and donations such as learning materials and sports equipment were also received from the Chinese side," she said.
The renovation addressed several critical issues, including damaged ceilings that had previously allowed pigeons to nest inside, she said.
Daw Thin Thin Khine, a teacher at the school, recalled how challenging the situation used to be. "Before, pigeons made the classrooms dirty with their droppings, which was unhealthy for the students," she explained.
"After the renovation, the classrooms are now clean and tidy. We are truly thankful to China for fulfilling the needs of our school, students, and community," she said.
The renovation work also tackled the problem of flooding. Daw April Tun, another teacher, said that the flood-prone areas in front of the school have been filled with sand and covered with concrete.
"Before, the school grounds would flood, especially during the rainy season, making it hard for students to attend classes. Now, those areas are dry and safe, and students can even play there," she said.
Students themselves have noticed the significant improvements. Mg Phone Khant Wai, an 18-year-old in grade 11, shared his experience.
"I've been studying here for about two years. After the renovation, everything has changed a lot. We can now play football in the open areas, which were previously flooded during rainy days," he said.
"I'm very grateful to China for this support. The improvements are so convenient for both us and the school," he added. â–

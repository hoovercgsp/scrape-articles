ISLAMABAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's strong leadership and its peaceful foreign policies are the major driving factors behind the country's remarkable success, a Pakistani senator has said.
Speaking on Thursday at a book launch titled "China at 75: China Story-Standing Up to Getting Rich to Becoming Strong," Mushahid Hussain Syed, a senator and the chairman of the Pakistani senate's defense committee, said that the Chinese people and their well-being are the two major focuses of the Chinese leadership, which has overcome multiple challenges to achieve socio-economic development by lifting hundreds of millions of people out of acute poverty.
Addressing the event, Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, the author of the book, said that the current Chinese leadership's vision to achieve a stable, fair, and prosperous society through the rule of law, people-centric governance, and equal opportunity will have far-reaching effects not only on China but across the world.
At a time when developed countries were primarily focused on their own interests, the Chinese leadership has introduced the concept of a community with a shared future. This model emphasizes diplomatic relations built on win-win cooperation, rather than exploiting weaker nations, added Ramay, who also serves as the chief executive officer of the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilization Research and Development, a think-tank based in Islamabad.
"China gave the developing countries a new hope when the Chinese leadership proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, intending to share the dividends of prosperity to ensure peace and sustainable security," said Ramay.
Talking to Xinhua on the sidelines of the event, Ramay said that in his book, he quoted examples from China that can help Pakistani students and policymakers learn from China.
"China's progress tells us that there is no alternative to honest, selfless, and qualified leadership, and people-centric governance is the key to ensuring peace and prosperity," he said. â–

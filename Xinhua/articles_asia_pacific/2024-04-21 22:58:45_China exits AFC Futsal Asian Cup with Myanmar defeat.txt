BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China completed its campaign at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Futsal Asian Cup here on Sunday with a 3-1 defeat against Myanmar.
China, who was already eliminated from the group before the match due to two previous defeats, opened the scoring just seconds before the midway point of the first half following a corner.
China was inches from doubling its lead on 13 minutes with a superb shot from distance that cracked against the post.
However, the match then went Myanmar's way. The Southeast Asian side leveled the scores from a corner on 16 minutes, and completed its turnaround two minutes later when an attempted cross took a defection off a defender and was turned into China's net.
Myanmar extended its lead in the second half by taking advantage of China being overstretched during the powerplay, and scored from distance into an empty net.
The top four of the 16 teams competing in the Futsal Asian Cup will qualify for the FIFA Futsal World Cup from September 14 and October 6 in Uzbekistan.
As Uzbekistan has automatically qualified as hosts, the fifth-placed team will be determined via playoff matches if Uzbekistan progresses to the semifinals of the Futsal Asian Cup. â–

SINGAPORE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Travel Fair 2024 kicked off at Singapore's Suntec Convention and Exhibition Center on Friday.
Held by the China National Tourist Office in Singapore, the three-day event attracts 16 local travel agencies as well as several airlines from both countries.
Travel agencies are introducing deep travel packages, such as 11- or 12-day trips, to customers as a mutual visa-exemption arrangement in February enables Singaporeans to stay in China for up to 30 days.
"I am interested in Chongqing. It deserves a trip as an internet celebrity '3D mountain city.' The hot pot also attracts me," said a customer at the fair.
"We saw a steady growth in customers to China in recent months. Travel routes to Xinjiang, Zhangjiajie, and the Three Gorges Reservoir are popular," said Li Liangyi, president of China Express Travel.
Li noted that increasing flights between Singapore and China will unleash the potential for tourism in the future.
"Moreover, necessary mobile apps in China, like WeChat and Alipay, are also popular in Singapore, which make local people's trips to China more convenient. Thus, a growing number of Singaporeans are choosing China as their travel destination," Li added. â–

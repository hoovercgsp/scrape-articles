RAYONG, Thailand, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's carmaker BYD opened its Thailand plant on Thursday, as its 8 millionth new energy vehicle (NEV) rolled off the assembly line in the factory, marking a milestone in the company's overseas expansion.
Located in the eastern Rayong province, BYD's Thailand plant completed its construction in just 16 months. With an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles, the plant's car making operation covers stamping, painting, welding, final assembly, and producing car components.

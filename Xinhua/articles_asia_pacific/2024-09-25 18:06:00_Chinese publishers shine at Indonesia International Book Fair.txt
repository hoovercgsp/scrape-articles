JAKARTA, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Chinese publishers on Wednesday showcased more than 700 volumes of premium Chinese books at the 2024 Indonesia International Book Fair (IIBF), held from Sept. 25-29 in Jakarta.
Organized by China National Sci-Tech Information Import & Export Co., Ltd, the collection featured over 400 types of books, covering topics such as traditional Chinese culture, Mandarin learning, literature, social sciences, children's books, and traditional Chinese medicine.
The delegation set up a digital reading stand showcasing Chinese history, culture, and advancements in fields like economics and ecology. The stand's interactive photo feature allowed visitors to capture memorable moments.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 Chinese nationals involved in online gambling and telecom fraud crimes have been repatriated from Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security said Wednesday.
The move was a result of the year-long joint operations by Chinese, Thai and Myanmar police targetting cross-border telecom fraud and online gambling, the ministry said in a press release.
Chinese police will step up international law enforcement cooperation and continue cracking down on these cross-border crimes, the ministry said. â–

JAKARTA, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's higher education institutions, along with China's companies and a vocational institution, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on vocational education collaboration on Friday.
The signing was witnessed by the Education and Culture Attache of the Indonesian Embassy in Beijing Yudil Chatim during Southeast Asia's largest trade exhibition, Trade Expo Indonesia, in BSD City, Tangerang.
"This collaboration aims to enhance the transfer of technology and knowledge, as well as to create synergy between education and industry, with various leading industries involved," said Yudil.
This collaboration is expected to encourage innovation, improve the quality of education in Indonesia, and open up job opportunities, while also potentially increasing the country's competitiveness on the global stage, he added.
Lulu Cao, marketing director of the global department of the Beifang Educational Technology, a Chinese vocational institution focused on automotive vocational education, told Xinhua: "We want to bring electric vehicle technology from China to education institutions in Indonesia to be implemented here so that local students could learn everything, especially the technology behind it."
Noting that the MoU is valid for the next five years, Lulu is confident that the scope of collaboration will expand in the future. â–

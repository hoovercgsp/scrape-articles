BEIJING, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Public Security on Monday announced that 313 Chinese nationals suspected of cross-border telecom fraud have been transferred from Myanmar to China.
This is the result of a joint law enforcement operation between Chinese and Myanmar police aimed at cracking down on telecom and online fraud in northern Myanmar.
A total of 870 suspects involved in cross-border telecom fraud were arrested during the operation, comprising 313 Chinese and 557 Myanmar nationals, the ministry said in a statement.
In March, Chinese and Myanmar police conducted their first joint law enforcement operation in the Muse region of Myanmar, arresting over 800 telecom fraud suspects.
The ministry said it will strengthen law enforcement cooperation with Myanmar police and conduct regular joint operations to combat telecom and online fraud involving Chinese nationals in northern Myanmar.
In May, the ministry said 49,000 criminal suspects of telecom and internet fraud had been handed over to China's custody by Myanmar since July 2023. â–

VIENTIANE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The first train traveling from Guiyang, capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province, to Lao capital Vientiane, arrived on Thursday, carrying over 200 Chinese tourists and making stronger links between Laos and China.
The train marked an important step in the development of high-quality tourism between China and Laos, with the China-Laos Railway being a pivotal link in the process.
The Lao Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism, in collaboration with the Laos-China Railway Co., Ltd. (LCRC), and the Lao National Art Troupe organized an impressive show to welcome the tourists arriving at the Lane Xang EMU train station, which the group enjoyed with some dancing to the music.
After arriving in Vientiane, the visitors will take a tour of the capital, followed by a trip to Vangvieng district in Vientiane province, and then to northern Laos' Luang Prabang province and other places of interest.
Initially, the tours on this route will be scheduled once a month. The LCRC and tourist authorities may increase the number of train trips depending on passenger demand.
The China-Laos Railway is a landmark symbol of the friendship between Laos and China and has been a great boost to the success of Visit Laos Year 2024.
Since the end of 2023, the LCRC and the Lao Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism have sought to bolster tourism in Laos through greater use of the railway.
The number of tourists coming to Laos via the China-Laos Railway is increasing, helping to fulfill the Lao government's ambition to rejuvenate the economy through tourism. â–

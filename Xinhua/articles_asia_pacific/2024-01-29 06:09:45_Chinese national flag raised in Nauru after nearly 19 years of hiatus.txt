YAREN, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese national flag-raising ceremony was held on Monday in Nauru by a Chinese diplomatic team, marking the first time in nearly 19 years that the five-star red flag has been raised in the Pacific island country.
The ceremony was held by the team responsible for reestablishing the Chinese embassy in Nauru in a compound that also houses their temporary offices.
The Nauruan government issued a statement on Jan. 15, announcing that it recognizes the one-China principle, severed the so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, and is willing to resume diplomatic relations with China.
China and Nauru signed a joint communique in Beijing on Jan. 24 on the resumption of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. â–

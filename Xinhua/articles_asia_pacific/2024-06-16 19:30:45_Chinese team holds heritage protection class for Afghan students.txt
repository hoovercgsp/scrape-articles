BAMIYAN, Afghanistan, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An outdoor class aimed at promoting cultural relics protection for Afghan primary school students kicked off Sunday in central Afghanistan's Bamiyan province.
The class was organized by a six-member team made of Chinese archaeologists and cultural heritage experts, along with Afghan experts and officials, respectively at the giant Buddhas site and Shahr-e Gholghola, both part of the UNESCO-listed world heritage in the Bamiyan Valley.
During the class, Afghan pupils were taught about the status quo of cultural relics protection in Bamiyan, practical skills needed for heritage protection, and the history of cultural exchanges between Afghanistan and China on the ancient Silk Road.
"I want to contribute to the future development of my country and work in the field of history and archaeology in the future," said Mohammad Zaid, a sixth grader in the class, who received a certificate for his good performance.
Bamiyan boasts several cultural relics sites, including two Buddha statues dating back more than 1,400 years. â–

VIENTIANE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Nam Tha 1 Lao Power Co., Ltd. have handed over a newly-built football field to a school in Hadnam village in northern Laos' Bokeo province.
The handover ceremony was held on Saturday at the Hadnam China-Laos Friendship School in Bokeo province, some 350 km northwest of the Lao capital Vientiane.
A student at the Hadnam China-Laos Friendship School said, "I'm very happy to receive this Children's Day gift!"
"We used to play football on an open ground, and we would get covered in mud when it rained. Now, I can run around and chase the ball wherever I want."
Speaking at the handover ceremony, director of the provincial department of education and sports Vandy Thammavong said sports are crucial to the healthy physical and mental development of students.
He added that the football field will help students grow up healthier and happier, and further enhance the friendship between Laos and China.
He expressed his hope that teachers and students will work together to maintain the football field so it will continue to benefit the growth of students.
Also speaking at the event, Liu Mingni, general manager of Nam Tha 1 Lao Power Co., Ltd, said the football field will further improve the infrastructure of the school, create a good sports environment for students, improve students' sports level and physical fitness, and make a positive contribution to enhancing the traditional friendship between China and Laos.
The China-Laos Friendship School in Hadnam village was built with assistance from China Southern Power Grid (CSG) in 2020 and has been successively equipped with facilities such as kitchens and book corners. â–

YANGON, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Amidst a burst of color and cultural exchange, Myanmar's local residents and overseas Chinese in the Southeast Asian country welcomed the auspicious Dragon Year Spring Festival with open arms.
On Sunday evening, the vibrant celebrations to mark the Chinese New Year took place at the Thuwunna National Indoor Sports Stadium (1) in Yangon, bringing together locals and Chinese expatriates.
The event, graced by the presence of State Administration Council Chairman Min Aung Hlaing and Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai, attracted over 500 people including officials, diplomats and businesspersons from Myanmar and China.
The celebration featured various cultural activities, including cultural booths and lion and dragon dances, among others.
Kaung Kaung, a 26-year-old lion and dragon dancer at the event, said, "I'm happy to attend the celebration. Lion and dragon dance is my favorite thing in the New Year celebration. Lion and dragon dance is also my life," adding that he has performed lion and dragon dances since he was 14 years old.
"I wish people good luck. May all people overcome all difficulties in this New Year," he added.
A friendly table tennis match between players from the Myanmar Table Tennis Federation (MTTF) and representatives from the Chinese embassy in Myanmar also took place during the event.

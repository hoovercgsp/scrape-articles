CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, May 26 (Xinhua) -- University, secondary and primary school students from across New Zealand's South Island on Sunday competed for Chinese proficiency in the annual "Chinese Bridge" Chinese Proficiency Competition.
Hosted by the Confucius Institute at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, 36 contestants, learning Chinese as their foreign language, showcased their talents and passion for the Chinese language, vying for spots for the global finals to be held later in China.
In the Chinese speech session, the contestants told their stories about their relationship with China or the Chinese language, as well as interesting stories about learning the Chinese language. They also showcased their Chinese talent through calligraphy, Tai Chi, Chinese dance and Chinese songs.
Chinese Consul General in Christchurch He Ying told the award ceremony that the competition opens a window for young Kiwis to know not only about the Chinese culture and civilization which has been unique and uninterrupted for more than 5,000 years, but also about the development of modern China through reform and opening up.
The "Chinese Bridge" competition also builds a bridge in promotion of relations between the two countries and peoples, as China remains New Zealand's largest trade partner, the largest source of international students, the third-largest source of international tourists after the COVID-19 pandemic, He said.
"There will be more and more job opportunities waiting for Chinese language learners," she said, adding more people who understand the Chinese language and culture are needed to make a contribution to the bilateral cooperation.
She welcomes more New Zealand students learning Chinese to visit China, and work and live in China in the future.
From the South Island final, the top winners from the three categories of contestants will be nominated directly to proceed to the final competitions later this year in China representing New Zealand's South Island. â–

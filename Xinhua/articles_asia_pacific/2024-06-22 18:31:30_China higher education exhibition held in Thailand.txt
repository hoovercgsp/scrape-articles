BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China higher education exhibition 2024 opened at Bangkokthonburi University in Thailand on Saturday, featuring 32 Chinese universities' participation and attracting large crowds of Thai students and teachers.
In his opening speech, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy Pirapan Salirathavibhaga hailed the exhibition as an opportunity to promote educational and academic exchanges and cooperation between Thailand and China.
"It also provides more choices for young students interested in studying in China, allowing them to learn about the development of China's higher education and various scholarship information," said Pirapan.
Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Han Zhiqiang noted that educational exchanges and cooperation remain an important part of China-Thailand cooperation, and the exhibition is the first large-scale event of its kind hosted in Thailand by the China Scholarship Council.
"It comprehensively introduces and displays the enrollment, major settings, training methods, and other information of dozens of famous Chinese universities, providing a rare opportunity for Thai teachers and students to have an in-depth understanding of Chinese universities," he added, highlighting its great significance to promote educational exchanges and cooperation between China and Thailand.

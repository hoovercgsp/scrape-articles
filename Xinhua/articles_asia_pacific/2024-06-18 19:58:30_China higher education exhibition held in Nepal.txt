KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China higher education exhibition 2024 was held here on Tuesday, drawing many Nepali students and parents.
A total of 31 Chinese universities participated in the exhibition and had interactions with students and parents.
The exhibition was first held in Nepal in 2003. It returned to the country after a ten-year hiatus.
There are as many as 2,500 Nepali students studying in China now, while the number of Chinese experts, scholars, university students and education volunteers who come to Nepal for study, research and teaching has been growing, noted Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song.
"Cultural exchange and educational cooperation between the two countries have become an important cornerstone of China-Nepal relations, injecting inexhaustible impetus to building a closer China-Nepal community with a shared future," Chen said while addressing the exhibition.
"I believe that this higher education exhibition will definitely open a window of information and build a bridge for Nepali students wishing to study in China," he added.
Education is one of the important areas of cooperation between Nepal and China. China has been supporting Nepal with different scholarship programs, short-term and long-term training programs and institutional collaboration, said Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Nepal's deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
"I believe this program will be a milestone in furthering our educational cooperation and people-to-people relations," he said of the exhibition. "I hope this exhibition provides an excellent opportunity for Nepali students to learn about higher education opportunities and prospects in China."
The exhibition was organized by China Scholarship Council and the Chinese Embassy in Nepal. â–

SUVA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- A China-aided renovation project of the Suva Multi-Purpose Sports Arena was handed over to Fiji on Friday.
The project, covering the Aquatic Center and National Hockey Center in the sports arena, was launched in June 2022 and funded by the Chinese government.
While addressing the handover ceremony, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka highlighted these venues' significance beyond sports, expressing gratitude for China's steadfast support, and anticipating the continued growth of the partnership and deeper collaborations in sports education and technology between both sides.
Chinese ambassador to Fiji Zhou Jian said that this project demonstrates the positive momentum of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides, and the bright future of China-Fiji cooperation in jointly building the Belt and Road.
The Chinese-funded Suva Multi-Purpose Sports Arena, including the Aquatic Center, National Hockey Center and the Vodafone Stadium, provided stages for spectacular sports scenes when Fiji hosted the 2003 "South Pacific Games." For more than 20 years, numerous events have taken place in these facilities.
The handover ceremony was attended by dignitaries, members of the diplomatic community and representatives from various sectors, marking a significant moment in Fiji-China relations and the development of sports infrastructure in the region. â–

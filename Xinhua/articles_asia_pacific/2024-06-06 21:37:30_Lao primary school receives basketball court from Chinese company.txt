VIENTIANE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Laos-China Railway Co., Ltd. (LCRC) has handed over a newly-built "Friendship Road" basketball court to the China-Laos Friendship Nongping Primary School in the Lao capital Vientiane.
In a handover ceremony held here on Wednesday, Lao Minister of Education and Sports Phout Simmalavong said the delivery of the basketball court is a move to further deepen the construction of a China-Laos community with a shared future.
He hopes that the school will make good use of sports facilities and equipment to train students to become pillars of the country and successors to the Laos-China friendship.
Also speaking at the event, Liu Hong, general manager of the LCRC, said the basketball court is one of the key projects of the LCRC for students and teachers, which will provide them with a more spacious and higher-quality teaching environment and improve students' athletic level and physical fitness.
On the occasion of International Children's Day, the LCRC also donated school bags, books and other teaching materials to seven primary schools along the Lao section of the China-Laos Railway.
The China-Laos Friendship Nongping Primary School is a demonstration project of China-Laos friendship. The school was funded by the China Foundation for Peace and Development in 2012. Since then, the foundation has been sending volunteer teachers and offering teaching materials to the school. â–

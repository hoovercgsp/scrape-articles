SYDNEY, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- All nine Chinese citizens who went missing on Thursday while diving in Palau have been rescued and are in good condition, the Chinese Embassy in the Federated States of Micronesia said on Friday.
The embassy received urgent information from overseas Chinese in the neighboring country of Palau on Thursday that seven Chinese nationals and two local diving guides of Chinese nationality had lost contact during their dive expedition to Peleliu Corner, an official of the embassy told Xinhua.
The embassy immediately activated the consular emergency response mechanism, contacted police in Palau, and asked the Palau side to spare no effort in its search and rescue.
Police in Palau told the Chinese embassy that a number of ships and aircraft had been deployed to carry out search and rescue operations. Overseas Chinese in Palau also voluntarily organized personnel and ships to participate in the search and rescue.
At present, all nine Chinese citizens who have been rescued are in good physical and mental condition, and have been sent to a local hospital for comprehensive examination. Consular officials of the Chinese embassy have spoken with the rescued people.
In the past year the Chinese Embassy in the Federated States of Micronesia has issued several safety advisories for Chinese citizens traveling to Palau, with which China does not have diplomatic relations.
Chinese citizens are advised to raise safety awareness, pay attention to risk prevention, abide by laws and regulations, and respect public order and customs when in Palau. They are also urged to learn how to keep safe, especially when participating in water-related activities. â–

JAKARTA, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is speeding up efforts to ship fresh durian directly to China, a minister said here.
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs Zulkifli Hasan led a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the preparation of the durian exports to China.
After the meeting, he said Indonesia sent durian to China in the form of durian paste, and the government plans to export fresh durian to the overseas market.
The minister said for the past years, the shipment of Indonesia's durian to China had to pass through Thailand's market, which decreased the profit for the growers. â–

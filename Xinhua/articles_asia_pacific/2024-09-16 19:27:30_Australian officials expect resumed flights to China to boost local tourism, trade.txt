CANBERRA, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of direct flights between south China's Guangzhou and South Australia's capital Adelaide will boost local trade and tourism, South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas said on Sunday.
Beginning on Dec. 11, China Southern Airlines will arrange three round-trip flights per week between Guangzhou and Adelaide, and the booking system is now open.
"This is another massive win for our state's tourism and trade sectors, which will see millions of dollars injected into our state year on year," Malinauskas told a press conference.
South Australia has been working to bring back international visitors who are not just here for a holiday, but those ready to invest in businesses, education, and exports, Malinauskas said.
Representatives from the South Australian government expressed full confidence in the development of local tourism, trade and other industries after the resumption of direct flights.
Acting Consul-General in Adelaide Pi Lijun said both sides should seize the opportunity of the positive and stable development of China-Australia relations, and take effective measures to maintain close communication and cooperation between the two sides in the fields of economy and trade, tourism, education and other areas.
Pi welcomed more Australians to visit China.
China Southern Airlines first launched its direct Guangzhou to Adelaide service in December 2016. The operations ceased in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. â–
